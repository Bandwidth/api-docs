# CNAM Per DIP API

## Overview

Bandwidth's Caller Name (CNAM) service is a low-cost per-query service that provides the Caller Name on VoIP calls in the US and Canada. With this service, the CNAM database is queried using a simple HTTPS GET Request. Once the request is made, the calling name is returned to the customer application or dial plan. The CNAM data is managed by the phone company who provides the phone numbers to its customers. Bandwidth can not guarantee the validity of the information returned by the managing phone company.

To utilize the CNAM lookup API, you will need to be setup with an account by your Account Manager. Please open a [support ticket](https://support.bandwidth.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to enable this feature for your account.
