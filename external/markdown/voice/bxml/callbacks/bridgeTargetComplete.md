##  Bridge Target Complete Event
If the originating call leaves the [&lt;Bridge&gt;](../verbs/bridge.md),
then this callback is sent to the `bridgeTargetCompleteUrl`,
and the BXML returned in it is executed on the target call.

### Expected response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8

<Response>
    <!-- BXML verbs to process in the target call -->
</Response>
```
