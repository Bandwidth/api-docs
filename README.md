# API-Docs

Welcome to the home of Bandwidth's API documentation! This repo contains the OpenAPI specifications that power Bandwidth's API references and SDKs, and will eventually replace https://github.com/bandwidth/bandwidth.github.io.

## Contribution Guidelines Overview

1) If you're adding a new OpenAPI spec, you will need to change the `docusaurus.config.js` file to both add a new item in the navbar items as well as add the spec as a custom field. You will need to create a new page for the spec under the `./site/src/pages` directory as well.
1) If you're adding a new markdown file and/or markdown directory, make sure to update the `sidebar.js` file in the `./site` directory
1) If your changes should come with a changelog update, make sure to update the changelog file. Otherwise, include the `no-changelog` tag on your PR.

## Docsite Generation

The `package.json` file contains node scripts that let you run dynamic docsite servers locally, as well as build and serve static versions of the site. The commands are as follows:

```sh
cd site
yarn install

npm run start   # run a dynamic site locally

# or
npm run build    # build a static site to the /site/build folder
nmp run serve    # host the static site in the /site/build folder
```

### site

The `./site` directory contains all of the content and configs needed to generate the docsite.

#### docusaurus.config.js

This file defines the configuration for the docusaurus site. The majority of changes to this file will come from adding a new spec to it. Below is an example of how to add a new spec

```js
//...
const newSpec = fs.readFileSync('./specs/newspec.json', 'utf-8');

//...

module.exports = {
  //...
  customFields: {
    //...
    newSpec: JSON.parse(newSpec),
    //...
  },
  //...
};
```

#### sidebar.js

This file defines the sidebar for the docusaurus site. Similar to the `docusaurus.config.js`, the majority of changes to this file will come from adding a new spec to it. Below is an example of how to add a new spec

```js
module.exports = {
  mySidebar: [
    //...
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'newService',
      items: [],
    },
    //...
  ],
};
```

#### /src

This directory mostly was autogenerated by docusaurus. The `components/` directory contains docusaurus config, the `css/` contains the css styling, and `pages/` contains the React code for the docsite pages.

#### /specs-source

This directory contains the unformatted OpenAPI specs. Specifically, this holds the specs before any Redoc custom code is inserted. Teams should add their specs to this directory.

#### /specs

The formatted OpenAPI specs used as the source of truth for the docsite will be placed in this directory. It is intentionally left empty outside of the `_keep` file (which only exists to keep the directory within git).

#### /docs

Markdown documents will be placed in this directory.

#### /blog

Will be filled out later, but blog files will go in here

#### /templates

Custom templates for any additions that people may need to use

### Postman

The `./postman` directory contains code and templates to generate our public facing Postman collection. The majority of the collection is generated from our OpenAPI specs, but `resources/postman_scaffold_collection.json` contains templates for Postman tutorials if someone wants to create one.

## PR Requirements

### Changelog Rules

Any changes to the `./site/specs` or `./site/docs` directories requires an update to `./site/src/pages/changelog.md`. If updating this isn't relevant, you must add the `no-changelog` label to your PR.

## SDK Generation

The `./sdk-generation` directory contains code and config for our SDK generation that supports our public SDKs. Much like the docsite generation, typically you'll interface with this through NPM commands.

`npm run generate -- -l <LANGUAGE> -s <SPEC>` is the command to generate an SDK. The `-s` flag is optional; not including it will default to the SDK with all APIs. The file `./sdk-generation/bandwidth.zip` will contain the generated code.

| Language | Notes |
|--|--|
| python | |
| ruby | |
| csharp | |
| java | |
| php | PHP >= 7.2
| phpold | Does not have XML support |
| node | Highly recommended to generate with a specified spec |
