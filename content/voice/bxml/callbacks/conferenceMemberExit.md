## Conference Member Exit Event
The Conference Member Exit event is fired whenever a caller exits a [conference](../verbs/conference.md) that specified a `callbackUrl`.  

The response may be either empty or a BXML document. Only the following verbs are valid for conferences:
* [`PlayAudio`](../verbs/playAudio.md)
* [`SpeakSentence`](../verbs/speakSentence.md)
* [`StartRecording`](../verbs/startRecording.md)
* [`StopRecording`](../verbs/stopRecording.md)
* [`PauseRecording`](../verbs/pauseRecording.md)
* [`ResumeRecording`](../verbs/resumeRecording.md)

Audio verbs will be heard by all members of the conference. Recordings capture audio from all members
who are not muted or on hold, as well as any audio verbs that are played into the conference.
