##  Transfer Disconnect Event – <Transfer> verb
This event is sent to the `transferDisconnectUrl` of each `<PhoneNumber>` tag when its respective call leg ends for any reason.
The event is sent in the normal case, when the transferred leg is answered and later hung up, but is also sent if the new leg
was never answered in the first place, if it was rejected, and if the original call leg hung up before the transferred leg.

The `cause` for a `transferDisconnect` event on a call can be:
- `hangup`: one party hung up the call, a [`<Hangup>`](../../bxml/verbs/hangup.md) verb was executed, or there was no more BXML to execute; it indicates that the call ended normally.
- `busy`: the callee was busy.
- `timeout`: the call wasn't answered before the `callTimeout` was reached.
- `cancel`: the call was cancelled by its originator while it was ringing.
- `rejected`: the call was rejected by the callee.
- `callback-error`: a BXML callback couldn't be delivered to your callback server.
- `invalid-bxml`: invalid BXML was returned in response to a callback.
- `application-error`: an unsupported action was tried on the call, e.g. trying to play a .ogg audio.
- `account-limit`: the account rate limits were reached.
- `node-capacity-exceeded`: the system maximum capacity was reached.
- `error`: some error not described in any of the other causes happened on the call.
- `unknown`: some unknown error happened on the call.

Note: this list is not exhaustive and other values can appear in the future.
