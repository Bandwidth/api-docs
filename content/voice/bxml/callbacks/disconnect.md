## Disconnect Event

The Disconnect event is fired when a call ends, for any reason. The `cause` for a disconnect event on a call can be:
- `hangup`: one party hung up the call, a [`<Hangup>`](../../bxml/verbs/hangup.md) verb was executed, or there was no more BXML to execute; it indicates that the call ended normally.
- `busy`: the callee was busy.
- `timeout`: the call wasn't answered before the `callTimeout` was reached.
- `cancel`: the call was cancelled by its originator while it was ringing.
- `rejected`: the call was rejected by the callee.
- `callback-error`: a BXML callback couldn't be delivered to your callback server.
- `invalid-bxml`: invalid BXML was returned in response to a callback.
- `application-error`: an unsupported action was tried on the call, e.g. trying to play a .ogg audio.
- `account-limit`: the account rate limits were reached.
- `node-capacity-exceeded`: the system maximum capacity was reached.
- `error`: some error not described in any of the other causes happened on the call.
- `unknown`: some unknown error happened on the call.

Note: this list is not exhaustive and other values can appear in the future.
