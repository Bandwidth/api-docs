{% method %}
##  Bridge Complete Event
If the target call leaves the [&lt;Bridge&gt;](../verbs/bridge.md),
then this callback is sent to the `bridgeCompleteUrl`,
and the BXML returned in it is executed on the call.

This callback is also sent if any problem occurs that prevents the calls to be bridged.

### Expected response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8

<Response>
    <!-- BXML verbs to process in the call -->
</Response>
```
