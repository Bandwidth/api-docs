##  Record Complete event

The Record Complete event is sent after a [`<Record>`](../verbs/record.md) verb has executed if the call is still active. The BXML returned by this callback is executed next.

When the recording is available for download, a [Recording Available](recordingAvailable.md) event will be sent.
