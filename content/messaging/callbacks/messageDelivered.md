# Message Delivered Event
In order to receive message events, you need to ensure you have set up your application to send callbacks to your server's URL.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT MMS AND GROUP MESSAGES!

MMS and Group messages do currently support delivery receipts. However, you will need to have this enabled. Without the delivery receipts enabled, you will still receive a message delivered event when the message is sent. The message delivered event will not represent true delivery for only MMS and Group Messages. This will mean your message has been handed off to the Bandwidth's MMSC network, but has not been confirmed at the downstream carrier.

### Example 2 of 4: Toll-free Message delivered to handset

* Toll free phone numbers support "device-level" delivery receipts which indicate that the end-users **device** has received the message.
* A [timeout response with error-code](messageFailed.md) : **9902 - Timed out waiting for delivery receipt. The reason a delivery receipt was not received is not known.** does **not** indicate that the message was not received. Only that the end-users' device did not communicate back to the network indicating the message was received during the DLR timeout window.
* A DLR when the **from** number is **toll-free** and the **status** is **ok** indicates that the message was indeed delivered to the end users' device.

### Example 4 of 4: Group MMS Message delivered to carrier

You will receive a unique callback per phonenumber sent in the group message. The example below shows **1 of the 2** callbacks that would be sent from Bandwidth.
