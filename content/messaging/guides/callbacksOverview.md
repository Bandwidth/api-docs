Bandwidth's Messaging API sends callbacks for every single message event. These are used for a wide range of scenarios, such as a message delivered, a message failed to deliver, and an inbound message received. A full list of what triggers callbacks can be found on our [message events page](../callbacks/messageEvents.md)

Your callback URL is set by your messaging application in the Bandwidth Dashboard.
