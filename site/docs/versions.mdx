# Bandwidth Documentation Versions

Bandwidth maintains both current and previous versions of our docsite and all of its contents.
What you will find here (dev.bandwidth.com), will always be the most up-to-date version of our docsite.
If you need to access an old version of our site, you can check the [Previous Versions](#previous-versions) table below.
Our versions use date-based versioning in the format `vYYYY.MM.DD`.

### Previous Versions

This table contains all of our publicly available previous versions of the doc site, which are snapshots of the site and its contents taken on the 1st and 16th of each month.
We maintain up to 12 previous versions, or 6 months of old content. After 6 months, the previous versions can still be accessed via Github, but will not be hosted online.
