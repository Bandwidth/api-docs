## Subscribing to Webhooks

### Participant Creation (beta)

The only API call that allows the registration of a callback / webhook is the `POST` to the `createParticipants` endpoint that is used to create a new Participant. If the `callbackUrl` property is included in the payload, the value associated with that property is assumed to be a URL which, if found to be valid, will be invoked on events that occur as part of the Participant life cycle.

:::note
Participant event webhooks are currently in Beta, and must be activated by submitting a support ticket to Bandwidth.

:::note
Participant event webhooks may change in the future. All attempts will be made to retain the syntax and semantics of the current implementation, but until Bandwidth completes the process of learning with our customers that the implementation is optimal, we cannot guarantee it. Bandwidth welcomes any and all comments on the implementation while in the Beta phase.

## Life Cycle Events

The events that will trigger invocation of the specified URL are:

- `onConnect` - establishment of a signaling connection to allow control of the flow of WebRTC Media.
- `onLeave` - removal of the signalling connection, prompted by server or client action.
- `onDisconnect` - loss of the signalling connection, possibly due to loss of IP connectivity, or departure of the client. This may be coincident with an `onLeave` event.

## Request Payload

The callback URL will be invoked by Bandwidth when the above events are detected. It will result in a `POST` to the URL specified as the value associated with the `callbackUrl` parameter. The Request Payload parameters that will be included in the `POST` body are...

| Property      | Description                                                                                                       |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| event         | one of `onConnect`, `onDisconnect` or `onLeave`                                                                   |
| timestamp     | a Timestamp of the event, in milliseconds                                                                         |
| participantId | The ID of the Participant that registered the `callbackUrl`                                                       |
| deviceId      | The id of actual device exchanging media                                                                          |
| tag           | (optional) The `tag` specified on Participant creation. If no `tag` was specified this field will not be present. |

## Examples

### an onLeave event

```json
POST http://yourUrl.com/participantEvent
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "event"        : "onLeave",
  "timestamp"    : "1628786234676",
  "participantId": "473f6544-92f7-4d67-9e77-bf2533cfff6d",
  "deviceId"     : "be199214-1a03-402a-a7b6-d002470a0465",
