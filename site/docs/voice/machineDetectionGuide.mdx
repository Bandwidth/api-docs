This guide will show you how to use machine detection, using the `machineDetection` parameter in a [call creation request](/apis/voice#operation/createCall).

You can choose to use either synchronous (sync) or asynchronous (async) mode for this operation.

## Async mode

When using the async mode, once the machine detection operation is completed, you will receive a [`machineDetectionComplete`](/docs/voice/webhooks/machineDetectionComplete) callback.

If async mode is selected, the `callbackUrl` needs to be specified. Also, you need to return proper BXML on the [`answer`](/docs/voice/webhooks/answer) callback in order for the call to not be hung up until the operation is complete.

The only required parameter for async mode is the callback url:

```json
{
  "from"             : "+15555551212",
  "to"               : "+15555551313",
  "answerUrl"        : "http://www.myapp.com/hello",
  "applicationId"    : "7fc9698a-b04a-468b-9e8f-91238c0d0086",
  "machineDetection" : {
    "callbackUrl": "http://www.myapp.com/machineDetectionComplete"
  }
}
```

:::tip
Other parameters can be configured as well, but are optional. Please see the [API reference](/apis/voice#operation/createCall) for more information.

## Sync mode

When using the sync mode, the [`answer`](/docs/voice/webhooks/answer) callback is delayed until the machine detection operation is completed. Also, you will not receive a [`machineDetectionComplete`](/docs/voice/webhooks/machineDetectionComplete) callback in this case.

The only thing needed to use the sync mode is to set the mode itself, since the default is async:

```json
{
  "from"             : "+15555551212",
  "to"               : "+15555551313",
  "answerUrl"        : "http://www.myapp.com/hello",
  "applicationId"    : "7fc9698a-b04a-468b-9e8f-91238c0d0086",
  "machineDetection" : {
    "mode": "sync"
  }
}
```
