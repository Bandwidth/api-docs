### How to gather user input (IVR)

In this guide we will show you how to collect digits inputted by a user on their phone’s keypad for a period of time. Please ensure you have followed our earlier guide on how to make an outbound call with Bandwidth.

You can gather a user’s input to create an interactive voice response (IVR) system.
Gathering User Input

The Gather verb is used to collect digits inputted by the user.

The gather is terminated when one of these conditions is met:

The user presses a terminating digit (if specified)
The user has pressed at least one key and more than interDigitTimeout seconds have elapsed
Any nested audio has ended and firstDigitTimeout seconds have elapsed without the user pressing any digits
The user presses maxDigits digits
If the gatherUrl attribute is specified, the Gather event is sent to the gatherUrl upon completion of the gather. BXML returned by that callback are then executed. If gatherUrl is specified, verbs following the `<Gather>` will be ignored.

If no gatherUrl attribute is specified, the gathered digits are discarded and execution of verbs following the `<Gather>` continues.

        To further enhance your IVR system, additional verbs can be nested inside of a <Gather> tag. These include playing media and text to speech.
