The Bandwidth Voice API allows you to handle incoming and outgoing PSTN phone calls using HTTP and JSON webhooks, giving you complete control over any call flow.

## Base URL

`https://voice.bandwidth.com/api/v2/accounts/{accountId}`

**Note** HTTP requests to our API use HTTP Basic authentication, which refers to your account's username and password.

## Calls

For help on how to make the proper requests to the API, check out the [API Reference](/apis/voice#operation/createCall) section of the docs. To quickly start making and receiving calls, check out the [guide](/docs/voice/quickStart).

### Creation/Acceptance

A <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> to `/calls` creates a call object in Bandwidth's network and returns a promise in the form of a unique `callId`. When creating a call you provide an `answerUrl` in the request body, and upon answer Bandwidth will send a webhook to the provided URL confirming and expecting BXML in the HTTP response to continue with the call.

To handle inbound calls to your Bandwidth numbers - you associate a [voice application](/docs/account/setup#create-a-voice-application) to a group of numbers, known as a Location or Sip-Peer. When incoming calls are received to any of those numbers, Bandwidth sends an [`initiate`](/docs/voice/webhooks/initiate) event webhook to the URL defined in your application and expects BXML in the HTTP response to continue with the call.

### Call Directions

The direction of which the call is coming from may determine how and where callbacks are sent, and whether they may submit more BXML. There are two directions, inbound and outbound. Inbound calls refer to calls received by your application, and outbound calls are calls that originate from your application.

### BXML

Bandwidth XML allows you to create a voice application as easily as you create a web application. Using Bandwidth XML (or BXML) your application handles incoming call events using standard action verbs that are described in XML.

When calls or call events occur - Bandwidth will send a request (webhook) to your service, expecting BXML in the HTTP response body to continue the call.

### Webhooks

The Voice API uses a number of different [webhooks](/docs/voice/webhooks) to facilitate call control. Certain webhooks expect BXML in the HTTP response to keep the call alive, while others are simply informative. These are referred to as callbacks in the previous docs.

### STIR/SHAKEN

The Bandwidth API uses STIR/SHAKEN to help combat fraudulent calls and phone number spoofing. This info can be seen in the [`initiate`](/docs/voice/webhooks/initiate) webhook. For more information, look [here](https://www.bandwidth.com/regulations/stir-shaken/) for Bandwidth's explanation of what it is and why it's important.

## Storage

### Media

The Voice API allows you to playback audio files to end users on phone calls. Only `.wav` and `.mp3` files are supported at this time and  Bandwidth recommends limiting audio files to less than 1 hour in length or 250 MB in size.

### Recordings

Bandwidth will keep recordings for up to 30 days. After 30 days the recordings will be deleted from Bandwidth's servers.

### Transcriptions

Bandwidth will keep transcriptions for up to 30 days. After 30 days the transcriptions will be deleted from Bandwidth's servers.

## Supported Languages and Environments

Supported languages for call control include XML, Java, C#, Ruby, NodeJs, Python, and PHP. Examples of the Bandwidth library in these languages are provided throughout the docs.

## Features and Services of Note

### Text-to-Speech

Use our [SpeakSentence](/docs/voice/bxml/speakSentence) verb to convert your words to speech, powered by Amazon Polly. Seventeen voices, twenty-six languages.

### Recording

Using the [Record](/docs/voice/bxml/record) verb, you can be confident you heard everything.

### Transcription

Want to read that call later? No problem! The [Record](/docs/voice/bxml/record) verb's `transcribe` function has you covered.

### Conferencing

The [Conference](/docs/voice/bxml/conference) BXML Verb allows customers to create conference calls.

### Answering Machine Detection

[Answering Machine Detection](/docs/voice/guides/machineDetection) allows applications to distinguish whether a human or machine is speaking on a call.

### Caller Name Service (CNAM)

Bandwidth's [Caller Name service](/docs/voice/guides/cnamPerDip) provides your business's name on VoIP calls in the US and Canada using our CNAM database. This feature must be enabled.
