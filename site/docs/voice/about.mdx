    Embed inbound and outbound voice capabilities via a set of well defined APIs - without the hassle of handling telecom infrastructure.
    <br/><br/>
    Rapidly develop voice-enabled applications by simply sending and receiving HTTPS requests.
    When an incoming call comes into a phone number associated with our Voice API platform, we will notify your application via a webhook event.
    Your application can then respond to our platform using Bandwidth XML (BXML) to launch any of our features.</p>,
