The Bandwidth Voice API allows you to handle incoming and outgoing PSTN phone calls using HTTP and JSON webhooks, giving you complete control over any call flow.

## Base URL

`https://voice.bandwidth.com/api/v2/accounts/{accountId}`

## Calls

### Creation/Acceptance

A <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> to [`/calls`](/apis/voice#operation/createCall) creates a call object in Bandwidth's network and returns a promise in the form of a unique `callId`. When creating a call you provide an `answerUrl` in the request body, and upon answer Bandwidth will send a webhook to the provided URL confirming and expecting BXML in the HTTP response to continue with the call.

To handle inbound calls to your Bandwidth numbers - you associate a [voice application](/docs/account/setup#create-a-voice-application) to a group of numbers, known as a Location or Sip-Peer. When incoming calls are received to any of those numbers, Bandwidth sends an [`initiate`](/docs/voice/webhooks/initiate) event webhook to the URL defined in your application and expects BXML in the HTTP response to continue with the call.

### BXML

Bandwidth XML allows you to create a voice application as easily as you create a web application. Using Bandwidth XML (or BXML) your application handles incoming call events using standard action verbs that are described in XML.

When calls or call events occur - Bandwidth will send a request (webhook) to your service, expecting BXML in the HTTP response body to continue the call.

### Webhooks

The Voice API uses a number of different [webhooks](/docs/voice/webhooks) to facilitate call control. Certain webhooks expect BXML in the HTTP response to keep the call alive, while others are simply informative.

## Storage

### Media

The Voice API allows you to playback audio files to end users on phone calls. Only `.wav` and `.mp3` files are supported at this time and  Bandwidth recommends limiting audio files to less than 1 hour in length or 250 MB in size.

### Recordings

Bandwidth will keep recordings for up to 30 days. After 30 days the recordings will be deleted from Bandwidth's servers.
