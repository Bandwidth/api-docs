The Gather verb is used to collect digits for some period of time.

## Text Content

There is no text content available to be set for the `<Gather>` verb.

## Attributes

| Attribute            | Description |
|:---------------------|:------------|
| gatherUrl            | (optional) URL to send [Gather event](/docs/voice/webhooks/gather) to and request new BXML. May be a relative URL. |
| gatherMethod         | (optional) The HTTP method to use for the request to `gatherUrl`. GET or POST. Default value is POST. |
| gatherFallbackUrl    | (optional) A fallback url which, if provided, will be used to retry the [Gather event](/docs/voice/webhooks/gather) callback delivery in case `gatherUrl` fails to respond. |
| gatherFallbackMethod | (optional) The HTTP method to use to deliver the [Gather event](/docs/voice/webhooks/gather) callback to `gatherFallbackUrl`. GET or POST. Default value is POST. |
| username             | (optional) The username to send in the HTTP request to `gatherUrl`. |
| password             | (optional) The password to send in the HTTP request to `gatherUrl`. |
| fallbackUsername     | (optional) The username to send in the HTTP request to `gatherFallbackUrl`. |
| fallbackPassword     | (optional) The password to send in the HTTP request to `gatherFallbackUrl`. |
| tag                  | (optional) A custom string that will be sent with this and all future callbacks unless overwritten by a future `tag` attribute or [`<Tag>`](/docs/voice/bxml/tag) verb, or cleared.<br/><br/>May be cleared by setting `tag=""`<br/><br/>Max length 256 characters. |
| terminatingDigits    | (optional) When any of these digits are pressed, it will terminate the Gather. Default value is `""`, which disables this feature. |
| maxDigits            | (optional) Max number of digits to collect. Default value is 50. Range: decimal values between 1 - 50. |
| interDigitTimeout    | (optional) Time (in seconds) allowed between digit presses before automatically terminating the Gather. Default value is 5. Range: decimal values between 1 - 60. |
| firstDigitTimeout    | (optional) Time (in seconds) to pause after any audio from nested `<SpeakSentence>` or `<PlayAudio>` verb is played (in seconds) before terminating the Gather. Default value is 5. Range: decimal values between 0 - 60. |
| repeatCount          | (optional) The number of times the audio prompt should be played if no digits are pressed. For example, if this value is `3`, the nested audio clip will be played a maximum of three times. The delay between repetitions will be equal to `firstDigitTimeout`. Default value is 1. `repeatCount` * number of verbs must not be greater than 20. |

The gather is terminated when one of these conditions is met:
 * The user presses a terminating digit (if specified)
 * The user has pressed at least one key and more than `interDigitTimeout` seconds have elapsed
 * Any nested audio has ended and `firstDigitTimeout` seconds have elapsed without the user pressing any digits
 * The user presses `maxDigits` digits

If the `gatherUrl` attribute is specified, the [Gather event](/docs/voice/webhooks/gather) is sent to the `gatherUrl` upon
completion of the gather. BXML returned by that callback are then executed. If `gatherUrl` is specified, verbs following the `<Gather>` will be ignored.

If no `gatherUrl` attribute is specified, the gathered digits are discarded and execution of verbs following the `<Gather>` continues.

## Nestable Verbs
The following verbs may be nested inside of a `<Gather>` tag.  If using a repeat count of one, up to 20 verbs can be nested. Refer to `repeatCount` attribute if using a value greater than 1.
