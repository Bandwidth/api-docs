The StartStream verb allows a segment of a call to be sent off to another destination for additional processing.

When used on a call, audio from one or both sides (tracks) of the call will be sent to the specified destination. The stream will continue until the call ends or the [`<StopStream>`][1] verb is used. A total of 4 concurrent track streams are allowed on a call. A `<StartStream>` request that uses `both` tracks will count as 2 concurrent streams.

## Text Content

There is no text content available to be set for the `<StartStream>` verb.

## Attributes

| Attribute          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name               | (optional) A name to refer to this stream by. Used when sending [`<StopStream>`][1]. If not provided, a random name will be generated and sent in the [`Media Stream Started`][2] webook.                                             |
| tracks             | (optional) The part of the call to send a stream from. `inbound`, `outbound` or `both`. Default is `inbound`.                                                                                                                    |
| destination        | (required) A websocket URI to send the stream to. The audio from the specified tracks will be sent via websocket to this URL encoded as base64 encoded PCMU/G711 audio. See below for more details on the websocket packet format. |
| streamEventUrl    | (optional) URL to send the associated Webhook events to during this stream's lifetime. Does not accept BXML. May be a relative URL.                                         |
| streamEventsMethod | (optional) The HTTP method to use for the request to `streamEventsUrl`. GET or POST. Default value is POST.                                                                                                  |
| username           | (optional) The username to send in the HTTP request to `streamEventsUrl`. If specified, the URLs must be TLS-encrypted (i.e., `https`).                                           |
| password           | (optional) The password to send in the HTTP request to `streamEventsUrl`. If specified, the URLs must be TLS-encrypted (i.e., `https`).                                           |

If the `streamEventsUrl` attribute is specified, then the [Media Stream Started][2], [Media Stream Rejected][3] and [Media Stream Stopped][4] events will be sent to the URL when the stream starts, if there is an error starting the stream and when the stream ends respectively. BXML returned in response to this callback will be ignored.

:::note
While multiple streams for the same call are allowed, each stream MUST have a unique name. Attempting to start a stream on the same call with the name of an already existing stream will result in a [Media Stream Rejected][3] event.

## Webhooks Received

| Webhooks                   | Can reply with more BXML |
|:---------------------------|:-------------------------|
| [Media Stream Started][2]  | No                       |
| [Media Stream Rejected][3] | No                       |
| [Media Stream Stopped][4]  | No                       |

## Nested Tags

You may specify up to 12 `<StreamParam/>` elements nested within a `<StartStream>` tag. These elements define optional user specified parameters that will be sent to the destination URL when the stream is first started.

### StreamParam Attributes

| Attribute | Description                                                    |
