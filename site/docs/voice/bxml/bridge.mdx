The Bridge verb is used to bridge another party (target call) onto the current call.

When the target call is bridged, any BXML being executed in it will be cancelled.

The bridge ends when one of the calls leaves the bridge.
A call leaves the bridge when it is hung up or when it gets [redirected](/apis/voice#operation/modifyCall//) to another BXML.

One of the [Bridge Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeComplete//) or [Bridge Target Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeTargetComplete//)
webhooks is sent when the bridge ends, to allow the call that remained in the bridge to execute new BXML. For example, if the call
that executed the Bridge verb hangs up or is [redirected](/apis/voice#operation/modifyCall//) first, the
[Bridge Target Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeTargetComplete//) webhook is sent and the BXML returned from that will
be executed on the bridge target. In this case, the [Bridge Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeComplete//) webhook is NOT sent.
Similarly, if the target of the Bridge verb hangs up or is [redirected](/apis/voice#operation/modifyCall//) first, the
[Bridge Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeComplete//) webhook is sent and the BXML returned from that will be executed
on the call that executed the Bridge. In this case, the [Bridge Target Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeTargetComplete//) webhook
is not sent.

There are certain circumstances in which calls cannot be bridged, such as when the target call:
  * is outbound and is still not answered
  * is executing [Forward](/docs/voice/bxml/forward//)
  * is already hung up

In any of those cases a [Bridge Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeComplete//) event is sent with an error message.
