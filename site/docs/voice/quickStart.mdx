Our quick start guide will walk you through how easy it is to get setup with Bandwidth and start writing a few lines of code to build your application.

## Assumptions
You must complete the following before proceeding:
1. You have been contracted and given access to your Bandwidth Dashboard Account. If you have not signed up to Bandwidth then please reach out to our sales team here.
2. Your account is enabled for **HTTP Voice** 
3. You have created an **API only user** and obtained [authentication credentials](/docs/account/credentials/)
4. You have created a **Sub-Account** and **Location** following our [account setup](/docs/account/dashboard-setup/)

## Steps
1. [Create your application](/#create-your-application)
2. [Create a Voice application](/#create-a-voice-application)
3. [Assign Voice Application to Location](/#assign-voice-application-to-location)

## Create your application
To use our Voice API, you must have created and configured your application using callback URLs to direct traffic and receive input from phone calls via BXML commands.

### What is BXML?
BXML webhooks are HTTP requests made by the Bandwidth platform to endpoints specified by you in your HTTP requests and BXML. Their purpose is to: 

1. Inform you of events that have happened in the call flow
2. Receive instructions from your application on what to do next.

More information on BXML can be found [here](/docs/voice/bxml/).

### Creating your application

Every application requires a [`CallInitiatedCallbackUrl`](/docs/voice/webhooks/initiate/), as this is the URL Bandwidth sends an initiated webhook to when an inbound call to a Bandwidth number is made, and a BXML response is expected to continue the call.

For inbound calls, Bandwidth will also send disconnect webhooks to the configured `CallStatusCallbackUrl`. This webhook is useful for error checking and includes the cause of the disconnect, for example rejected or hung up. 
You may choose to handle this webhook with the same server you use for standard voice webhooks. It is highly recommended to use a unique endpoint to separate these callbacks from other voice webhooks. 
You can also use Pipedream, a tool for logging callbacks.

For outbound calls, the other most widely used callback URL is the [`answerUrl`](/docs/voice/webhooks/answer/) in the POST request made to start a call from a Bandwidth number. 
Like the [`CallInitiatedCallbackUrl`](/docs/voice/webhooks/initiate/) for inbound calls, Bandwidth will expect BXML in the HTTP response URL to continue the call using BXML verbs.

The [`CallInitiatedCallbackUrl`](/docs/voice/webhooks/initiate/) and [`answerUrl`](/docs/voice/webhooks/answer/) can be the same or different, depending on if you would like inbound and outbound calls to be handled differently.

There are a few methods you can follow to setup your application.

#### 1. Creating a Personal Server

Many of the [Bandwidth Samples](https://github.com/Bandwidth-Samples) include code for setting up a local server.
When using a locally hosted server, you will not have a valid callback URL, an easy fix for this is hosting your local server somewhere online.
A useful tool for hosting local sites on web accessible links is [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Your ngrok link can be used as the domain for your callback URLs.

#### 2. Using Pipedream

Pipedream is a serverless platform for connecting APIs.
Pipedream already has integration for the Bandwidth API. All of the connected tools may be found [here](https://pipedream.com/apps/bandwidth/integrations/pipedream).
With a Pipedream source or workflow set up, the assigned Pipedream endpoints can be set as your respective callback URLs.

## Create a Voice Application

Once you have created your application, you need to tell us where to find it. You can create multiple applications to handle different call flows for your numbers. 

You will need to create a Voice Application and then associate it with your phone number’s Location, created during the initial account setup.
1. In the top navigation bar, click **Applications**, and then click **Create New**.
2. Provide an **Application name** (we recommend you use something that identifies what the application will do).
3. Under **Application type**, select **Voice**. Note: Once your application is created, you won’t be able to change the application type.
4. Enter your Callback URL(s)
5. Click **Create Application**

## Assign Voice Application to Location

You are now ready to assign your created Voice Application to the Location you created in the initial quick start guide.

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Accounts**, and then click **Locations** in the sub-menu
2. Select your existing created location
3. Select the **Voice** tab
4. Under **Voice Method** select **HTTP**
5. Select your existing created application for the **Associated Voice Application**
6. Click **Save Changes**

## Where to next?

Now that you have successfully setup your account, you are ready for our next step! 

Please note, before you make your first call you must purchase a phone number. Follow our guide on [How to search and order phone numbers](/docs/numbers/guides/searchingForNumbers/) to do this via the Portal.

Once you have done this, you are ready to make your first phone call.
