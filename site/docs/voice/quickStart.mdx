Our quick start guide will walk you through how easy it is to get setup with Bandwidth and start writing a few lines of code to build your application.

## Assumptions
You must complete the following before proceeding:
1. You have been contracted and given access to your Bandwidth Dashboard Account. If you have not signed up to Bandwidth then please reach out to our sales team here.
2. Your account is enabled for **HTTP Voice** 
3. You have created an **API only user** and obtained [authentication credentials](/docs/account/credentials/)
4. You have created a **Sub-Account** and **Location** following our [account setup](/docs/account/dashboard-setup/)

## Steps
1. [Setup your callback server](#setup-your-callback-server)
2. [Create your Voice application](#create-your-voice-application)
3. [Assign Voice Application to Location](#assign-voice-application-to-location)

## 1. Setup your callback server

  alt="Setup your callback server"

/>
<br/>

To use our Voice API, you must have configured your development environment and created a callback server.

You can test our APIs using our [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/bandwidth?tab=collections) straight away. 
However, to create an outbound call you must have setup your callback URLs and created your voice application.

Once you have everything setup you can use one of our SDKs in your chosen language to help build your application with advance functionality.

### Voice API SDKs

- NodeJS - [@bandwidth/voice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bandwidth/voice)
- Python - [bandwidth-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/bandwidth-sdk/)
- Java - [com.bandwidth.sdk/bandwidth-sdk](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.bandwidth.sdk/bandwidth-sdk)
- PHP - [bandwidth/sdk](https://packagist.org/packages/bandwidth/sdk)
- Ruby - [bandwidth-sdk](https://rubygems.org/gems/bandwidth-sdk)
- C# - [bandwidth-sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bandwidth.Sdk/)

### What are Callback URLs?

Bandwidth uses callback URLs to talk to your application to direct traffic and receive input from phone calls. This is done in the form of Bandwidth XML (BXML) commands. 
For example, for an inbound call you may want to transfer this call to another number using a BXML command.

The two required types of Callback URLs are:
- **CallInitiatedCallbackUrl** - The URL Bandwidth sends an initiated webhook to when an inbound call to a Bandwidth number is made, and a BXML response is expected to continue the call.
- **CallStatusCallbackUrl** - The URL Bandwidth will send disconnect webhooks which is useful for error checking and includes the cause of the disconnect, for example rejected or hung up. 

#### What is BXML?

BXML is an XML based language which instructs Bandwidth how to handle various events for incoming and outgoing calls. 
BXML webhooks are HTTP requests made by the Bandwidth platform to endpoints specified by you in your HTTP requests and BXML. Their purpose is to: 

1. Inform you of events that have happened in the call flow
2. Receive instructions from your application on what to do next.

![BXML How-to](@site/static/img/docs-diagrams/voice/bxml-how.png)

More information on BXML can be found [here](/docs/voice/bxml/).

### Accessible Callback URLs

When using a locally hosted server, you will not have a valid callback URL. 
To quickly test your application without having to deploy it to Heroku or AWS you can follow one of these lightweight methods.

##### 1. Ngrok

Ngrok exposes local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels providing a domain for your callback URLs.

This provides a unique URL on the ngrok.io domain which forwards incoming requests to your local development environment [here](https://ngrok.com/).

<br/>

##### 2. Pipedream

Pipedream is a serverless platform for connecting APIs.
With a Pipedream source or workflow set up, the assigned Pipedream endpoints can be set as your respective callback URLs.

Pipedream already has integration for the Bandwidth API. All of the connected tools may be found [here](https://pipedream.com/apps/bandwidth/integrations/pipedream).

## 2. Create your Voice Application

  alt="Create your Voice Application"
  class="center"
/>
<br/>

Once you have setup your development environment and accessible Callback URLs, you need to tell us where to find it. You can create multiple applications to handle different call flows for your numbers. 

You will need to create a Voice Application and then associate it with your phone number’s Location, created during the initial account setup.

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Applications**, and then click **Create New**.
2. Provide an **Application name** (we recommend you use something that identifies what the application will do).
3. Under **Application type**, select **Voice**. Note: Once your application is created, you won’t be able to change the application type.
4. Enter your Callback URL(s)
5. Click **Create Application**

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Accounts**, and then click **Locations** in the sub-menu
2. Select your existing created location
3. Select the **Voice** tab
4. Under **Voice Method** select **HTTP**
5. Select your existing created application for the **Associated Voice Application**
6. Click **Save Changes**

<br/>

## Where to next?

Now that you have successfully setup your account, you are ready for our next step! 

Please note, before you make your first call you must purchase a phone number. Follow our guide on [How to search and order phone numbers](https://support.bandwidth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011094753-How-do-I-search-and-order-phone-numbers) to do this via the Dashboard.

Once you have done this, you are ready to make your first phone call.
