This guide will show how to do call recording via the [Record](/docs/voice/bxml/record) and [StartRecording](/docs/voice/bxml/startRecording) verbs.

### Record

The Record verb starts recording in a call and pauses all BXML execution until the recording is terminated by a timeout (`maxDuration`) or a terminating digit (`terminatingDigits`). Once the recording ends, BXML execution will continue at the next verb, or at the BXML at the `recordCompleteUrl` if this attribute is set.

If the `recordingAvailableUrl` attribute is set, this URL will receive a callback once the recording is available to use.

#### Use `<Record>` if:

* You're capturing a voicemail
* You only need a single party recording
* You're capturing input that should pause the call until finished

#### Record Example

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Record recordCompleteUrl="https://myapp.com/nextBXML" maxDuration="10"/>
</Response>
```

### StartRecording

The StartRecording verb starts recording in a call without pausing BXML execution. The [PauseRecording](/docs/voice/bxml/pauseRecording), [ResumeRecording](/docs/voice/bxml/resumeRecording), and [StopRecording](/docs/voice/bxml/stopRecording) BXML verbs can be used to toggle the recording. Recording is terminated by either the call ending, or by a StopRecording verb.

Much like the Record verb, StartRecording also has a `recordingAvailableUrl` attribute to receive the recording available callback.

#### Use `<StartRecording>` if:

* You want to record both ends (together or separate) of a phone call
* You want to record a call for quality assurance
* You need other BXML verbs to execute while a recording is going on

#### StartRecording Examples

##### Basic StartRecording

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <StartRecording recordingAvailableUrl="https://myapp.com/noBXML"/>
</Response>
```

##### StartRecording Used With StopRecording, PauseRecording, and ResumeRecording

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <StartRecording recordingAvailableUrl="https://myapp.com/noBXML"/>
    <SpeakSentence voice="bridget">Recording is active while this sentence is being spoken.</SpeakSentence>
    <PauseRecording/>
    <SpeakSentence voice="bridget">Recording has been paused.</SpeakSentence>
    <ResumeRecording/>
    <SpeakSentence voice="bridget">Recording has been resumed and is active while this sentence is being spoken.</SpeakSentence>
    <StopRecording/>
    <SpeakSentence voice="bridget">Recording has been stopped.</SpeakSentence>
</Response>
```

### Transcriptions

If you want to do a transcription of your recording, you can add a `transcribe` attribute to your `Record` or `StartRecording` BXML verbs. If you want to receive a [TranscriptionAvailable](/docs/voice/webhooks/transcriptionAvailable) callbacks, you can set the `transcriptionAvailableUrl` to your URL of choice, and `transcriptionAvailableMethod` to your HTTP method (`GET` or `POST`).

Transcription can succeed only for recordings of length greater than 500 milliseconds and less than 4 hours.

#### Recording Transcription Example

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
   <Record transcribe="true" transcriptionAvailableUrl="https://transcription.url.server/transcribe/" transcriptionAvailableMethod="POST"/>
</Response>
```
