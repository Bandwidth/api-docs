import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

If the originating call leaves the [`<Bridge>`](/docs/voice/bxml/bridge), then this callback is sent to the `bridgeTargetCompleteUrl`, and the BXML returned in it is executed on the target call.

Note: if this webhook is sent, the [Bridge Complete](/docs/voice/webhooks/bridgeComplete) webhook is NOT sent.
