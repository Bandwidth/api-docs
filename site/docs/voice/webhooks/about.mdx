# Webhooks

BXML webhooks are HTTP requests made by the Bandwidth platform to endpoints specified by you in your HTTP requests, BXML and in your Voice application. Their purpose is to:
  1. inform you of events that have happened in the call flow
  2. receive instructions from your application on what to do next.

## Synchronous Webhooks

BXML webhooks are HTTP <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> requests by default. The request will have a JSON body that describes the event and expect an XML response consisting of [BXML verbs](/docs/voice/bxml).

:::note
HTTP <Highlight color="#00bf8c">GET</Highlight> requests may be used for webhooks by setting the appropriate `Method` attribute when specifying each 's URL. If the <Highlight color="#00bf8c">GET</Highlight> method is used, the properties are passed as query parameters. This can cause very long URLs, so <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> is the preferred method.
:::

We use a 15s request timeout by default when trying to deliver all s. However, you can customize that value [when creating an outbound call](/apis/voice#operation/createCall) by setting a `callbackTimeout` on the request; or with application settings for inbound calls.

:::tip
Relative URLs are allowed in BXML verb attributes and they will be resolved against the URL of the server that provided the BXML containing the relative URL. For example, if we send an [answer event](/docs/voice/webhooks/answer) to `https://example.com/answer` and the BXML sent back to us contains a [Gather](/docs/voice/bxml/gather) with a `gatherUrl=/onGatherComplete`, the [gather event](/docs/voice/webhooks/gather) will be sent to `https://example.com/onGatherComplete`.

## Asynchronous Webhooks

Asynchronous webhooks are HTTP requests made by the Bandwidth platform to endpoints specified by you in your HTTP requests and BXML. The HTTP <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> method is used by default. The request will have a JSON body that describes the event.  An HTTP 201 response with no content is expected.  HTTP 200 is also acceptable. If there is a response body (including BXML), it will be ignored.

:::note
HTTP <Highlight color="#00bf8c">GET</Highlight> requests may be used for webhooks by setting the appropriate `Method` attribute when specifying each 's URL. If the <Highlight color="#00bf8c">GET</Highlight> method is used, the properties are passed as query parameters. This can cause very long URLs, so <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> is the preferred method.
