This event is sent to the `transferCompleteUrl` of the A-leg's `<Transfer>` verb when the transferred call (B-leg) completes. In a simultaneous ringing scenario, only one B-leg succeeds and this event corresponds to that successful leg. If none of the calls were answered, the `transferComplete` event corresponds to one of the legs.

The `cause` for a `transferComplete` event on a call can be:
  - `hangup`: one party hung up the call, a [`<Hangup>`](/docs/voice/bxml/hangup) verb was executed, or there was no more BXML to execute; it indicates that the call ended normally.
  - `busy`: the callee was busy.
  - `timeout`: the call wasn't answered before the `callTimeout` was reached.
  - `cancel`: the call was cancelled by its originator while it was ringing.
  - `rejected`: the call was rejected by the callee.
  - `callback-error`: a BXML callback couldn't be delivered to your callback server.
  - `invalid-bxml`: invalid BXML was returned in response to a callback.
  - `application-error`: an unsupported action was tried on the call, e.g. trying to play a .ogg audio.
  - `account-limit`: the account rate limits were reached.
  - `node-capacity-exceeded`: the system maximum capacity was reached.
  - `error`: some error not described in any of the other causes happened on the call.
  - `unknown`: some unknown error happened on the call.
