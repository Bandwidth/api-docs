import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
    <span
      style={{
        backgroundColor: color,
        borderRadius: '2px',
        color: '#fff',
        padding: '0.2rem',
      }}>
      {children}
    </span>
  );

The Conference Redirect event is fired whenever an existing [conference](/docs/voice/bxml/conference) is modified via a <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> request made to the [/conferences/{conferenceId}](/apis/voice#operation/modifyConference) endpoint.

The response may be either empty or a BXML document. Only the following verbs are valid for conferences:
  * [`PlayAudio`](/docs/voice/bxml/playAudio)
  * [`SpeakSentence`](/docs/voice/bxml/speakSentence)
  * [`StartRecording`](/docs/voice/bxml/startRecording)
  * [`StopRecording`](/docs/voice/bxml/stopRecording)
  * [`PauseRecording`](/docs/voice/bxml/pauseRecording)
  * [`ResumeRecording`](/docs/voice/bxml/resumeRecording)
