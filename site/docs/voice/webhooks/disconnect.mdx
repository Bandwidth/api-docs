The Disconnect event is fired when a call ends, for any reason. The `cause` for a disconnect event on a call can be:
  - `hangup`: one party hung up the call, a [`<Hangup>`](/docs/voice/bxml/hangup) verb was executed, or there was no more BXML to execute; it indicates that the call ended normally.
  - `busy`: the callee was busy.
  - `timeout`: the call wasn't answered before the `callTimeout` was reached.
  - `cancel`: the call was cancelled by its originator while it was ringing.
  - `rejected`: the call was rejected by the callee.
  - `callback-error`: a BXML callback couldn't be delivered to your callback server.
  - `invalid-bxml`: invalid BXML was returned in response to a callback.
  - `application-error`: an unsupported action was tried on the call, e.g. trying to play a .ogg audio.
  - `account-limit`: the account rate limits were reached.
  - `node-capacity-exceeded`: the system maximum capacity was reached.
  - `error`: some error not described in any of the other causes happened on the call.
  - `unknown`: some unknown error happened on the call.
