The Record Complete event is sent after a [`<Record>`](/docs/voice/bxml/record) verb has executed if the call is still active. The BXML returned by this callback is executed next.

When the recording is available for download, a [Recording Available](/docs/voice/webhooks/recordingAvailable) event will be sent.
