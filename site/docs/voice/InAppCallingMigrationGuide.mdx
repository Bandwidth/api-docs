# Bandwidth In-App Calling

Bandwidth offers a *In-App Calling* calling capability that allows our customers to use WebRTC voice capabilities present in web and mobile devices to place calls to critical destinations served by the Bandwidth voice network, allowing access to Bandwidth network services, quality and reach to advance any and all business needs surfaced by web browsers and mobile applications.

The Bandwidth *In-App Calling* capability is designed for simplicity, reliability and voice quality; leveraging the Bandwidth Global voice network to deliver a voicepath that is managed from end to end.

Users of the *legacy* WebRTC Calling solution, will find improved performance and development simplicity with the In-App Calling solution: calls are simple to create, and they complete with negligable setup delay.

# Migration in a nutshell

A voice user of the legacy Bandwidth WebRTC solution will encounter a simpler programming model with In-App Calling; a solution that retains the critical security attributes of the old solution, but one that discards many of the session management responsibilities that contributed to overall solution complexity.  In addition, the complexity of managing the interaction between a webrtc session management 'side' and a SIP 'side' have been largely removed.

### A table of the changes looks like
| Legacy WebRTC Action | In-App Calling Action |
| --- | --- |
| Create a Participant | +not required+ |
| Retrieve a Participant Security Token | Retrieve a Security Token from id.bandwidth.com |
| Create a Session | +not required+ |
| Add a Participant to a Session | +not required+ |
| +not required+ | place a call to a telephone number |
| Manage Participants in a Session | +not required+ |
| Create a SIP Participant for a Voice Network connection | +not required+ |
| <transfer> or <bridge> a call for an outbound call | +not required+ |
| <bridge> a call for handling an inbound call flow | available via Programmable Voice |

### In other words
- where you used to create a Participant and use that Participant to obtain a security token, simply obtain a security token from id.bandwidth.com using your Bandwidth credentials
- where you used to make an outbound call by creating a Session, and creating and managing a SIP Participant to attach to that session in support of connecting to the Bandwidth Voice Network, simply initialize the in-browser SDK, add your security token to the SDK, and place a call to your intended voice destination.
- where you used to monitor the state of media connections and provided callbacks to determine the overall call state, simply listen to the call-back events provided by the browser SDK
- and where you had to do all that SIP Session and Participant stuff to create the environment for an inbound call, simply use Programmable voice to create a meet-in-the middle inbound calling experience. (see the sample application [webrtc-web-phone-ts](https://github.com/Bandwidth-Samples/webrtc-web-phone-ts) )
