Rate limits for the Voice API are set by account by your customer account manager. By default, rate limits are set to 3 CPS and 30 active sessions. If you think you may need additional voice capacity, please open a ticket with our Account Management team.

If a rate limit is hit when creating an outbound call the API will return a HTTP-429 informing the reason with the message `Account call creation rate limit exceeded` or `Account concurrent call limit exceeded`.

If a rate limit is hit during a `<Forward>`, the call will be allowed, but will still count against the limit, so subsequent calls may be rate limited.

If a rate limit is hit during a `<Transfer>`, the error will be sent to `transferCompleteUrl` also informing the reason in the `errorMessage` field.

As an alternative to hard rate limiting for outbound calls, you may have your account manager enable outbound call queueing. Your queue size is limited to a maximum of 5 minutes worth of outbound calls at your dequeing rate. More details on queueing calls can be found in the [calls api](/apis/voice#operation/createCall) documentation

There are no notifications when inbound calls are rejected due to rate limits.
