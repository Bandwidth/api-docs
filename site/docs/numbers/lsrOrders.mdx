[The LsrOrders endpoint](/apis/numbers#operation/CreateLsrOrder) is used to create, modify, and monitor API requests to remove telephone numbers from the Bandwidth network. This API call is intended for use by carriers that want to automate the "Port-out" process with Bandwidth, rather than manually request the removal or "port-out" of each telephone number via a GUI or a Ticket.

This API call uses an asynchronous model that is common in the Bandwidth Dashboard API, where an "order" is created that is then subsequently used to track the progress of the request to completion. This in somewhat analogous to the "laundry ticket" model, where the initial transaction is the submission of the laundry and the receipt of a ticket, and all other steps in the overall transaction use the identifier on the ticket to monitor and manage the transaction.

In this case a POST is made to the /lsrorders resource that describes the request to port out the number. If the POST has no syntactic errors, such as a telephone number with less than 10 digits, an ID will be returned that is used to monitor and manage the port-out request. The POST returns both a descriptive payload that reflects the request and includes the identifier, as well as a Location header that contains a valid GET API call that can be used to retrieve the current state of the LSR / Port-out request. In general the flow of events is much like...

       Carrier   ----->    POST        ----->      Bandwidth - the initial request
                <-----     200 OK     <-----                 - the response with a payload
                                                               and a Location header


       -- some subsequent event happens... an error, or the completion of the request --


       Carrier <----- Notification Callback <----- Bandwidth - if configured, Bandwidth
                                                               notifies the carrier of all
                                                               events that impact the order
                                                             - see the /subscriptions and
                                                               /callbacks API descriptions
       Carrier   ----->    GET(id)     ----->      Bandwidth - the carrier requests the
                                                               complete status of the order
                                                               using the ID
                <-----     200 OK     <-----                 - the response with a descriptive
                                                               payload


The above notifications continue until the LSR is complete or cancelled.
There is a complete list of elements in payload of the POSTed request below in the documentation of the POST, but in summary the LSR request includes:

- a list of telephone numbers
- information about the subscriber
- tracking information such as a PON and a Customer Order ID
- winning carrier information such as the SPID
- date information
This API supports GET for retrieving order detail and status information, POST for creating a new LSR Order, and PUT for changing the details of an LSR in flight.
PUT is also used to cancel an order, by changing the order status field to cancelled.  This is the only case where the status can be changed, and when this is done, all other fields are left as they were prior to the cancellation.

* POST - errors occur during LSR creation.
* PUT - errors occur during LSR supp/cancel.
* PROCESSING - errors occur while LSR processing. These errors are persistent and can be retrieved using GET requests (ex. by LSR ID).

\* Error messages can differ from described depending on context of occurrence.
