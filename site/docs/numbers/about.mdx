The Bandwidth Dashboard API is where you will purchase, port, provision, and manage all of the telephone numbers in your inventory that you use for calls and messages on the Bandwidth network.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the [Account Structure](/docs/account/structure/) and [Account Setup](/docs/account/dashboard-setup/) guides to ensure everything you will need for provisioning API calls is set up before beginning your testing or development.
