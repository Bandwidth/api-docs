## Numbers v2 API

### Introduction
V2 of the Numbers API introduces several changes that make it possible for Numbers to handle international numbers with country codes. This is done via the introduction of e164 format as the standard across the API.
This format takes the form of a plus sign followed by a country code, followed by a full telephone number.
ex. +19805556666
In the above example, +1 is the additional portion that represents this as a number belonging to the United States.
In order to integrate with V2 of the Numbers API, you will need to make several changes to match this new format.
- Update endpoint calls to use ‘v2’ instead of ‘v1’ in the routes
- Update your callback subscriptions to be e164 compliant
- Update all of your code that involves Telephone Numbers to send numbers in e164 format, as well as to expect Numbers to return e164 format to you.

### Updates from v1
Search endpoint now takes new parameters
<Tabs groupId="numbers_v2_api_migration" defaultValue="v2" values={[ { label: 'v1', value: 'v1', }, { label: 'v2', value: 'v2', } ]}>
  <TabItem value="v1">

    ```java

    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2">

    ```java

    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Breaking Changes
- The filter on area codes now enforces a country code filter as a part of its checks. This is to ensure adherence to the new e164 format.
- The e911 address is moving from /addresses to /e911addresses to make room for new additions at that route
- V2 now handles area codes as strings to accommodate international area codes that include a leading zero. The string will encompass both the country and area code. i.e. +27(098)5556666 would have a string portion containing “+27098” and an integer with the value 5556666.
