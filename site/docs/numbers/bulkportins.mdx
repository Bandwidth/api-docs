The bulkPortins endpoint is used to manage requests to port a diverse collection of Telephone Numbers into the Bandwidth Dashboard. These telephone numbers will be decomposed into a set of individual port-in orders based on port-type, losing carrier, losing RespOrg, etc., making all reasonable attempts to treat the individual port-in requests in a uniform manner. Like many other requests, the bulkPortins endpoint causes the creation of a Bulk Portins order that is used to manage the porting event throughout the lifecycle of the request.

When a bulk port-in is created successfully, it will have one or more child port-in orders that satisfy the following industry port-in rules:

* Telephone numbers in a child port-in order all have the same port-type (e.g. toll free, automated on-net, automated off-net, internal, etc.).
* Non-toll free telephone numbers in a child port-in order all have the same losing carrier.
* Toll free telephone numbers in a child port-in order all have the same losing RespOrg.

The elements used or supplied in the bulk port-in payload are described in the table below. The values supplied in the bulk port-in payload are cascaded to the child port-in orders when possible. This is useful, for example, if you want all of the child orders to have the same CustomerOrderId, or RequestedFocDate.

All bulk port-ins start in a draft processing status and remain in a draft state until explicitly submitted by setting the bulk port-in ProcessingStatus to IN_PROGRESS. The bulk order starts in “DRAFT” state until telephone numbers are added using the /tnList endpoint. Once telephone numbers are added, the order transitions to VALIDATE_DRAFT_TNS, and from there to either VALID_DRAFT_TNS, or INVALID_DRAFT_TNS. If there are invalid, or non-portable telephone numbers, a GET on /tnList will show the errors. If all telephone numbers are portable, child port-in orders are created to handle the actual port-ins.

A bulk port-in order may have one of 3 terminal processing statuses: COMPLETED, CANCELLED, or PARTIAL, which are just an aggregation of the child order statuses. An order in a “terminal” state will never transition to any other processing status (terminal or not). A bulk port-in order goes to a terminal status automatically as soon as the last of its associated child port-ins transfers to terminal status (COMPLETE or CANCELLED). The resulting terminal processing status of the bulk port-in order depends on statuses of associated child port-ins: COMPLETED - when all child port-ins are in COMPLETE status, CANCELLED - when all child port-ins are in CANCELLED status, PARTIAL - when there is a mix of CANCELLED and COMPLETE child port-in statuses.

The following table describes parameters for the bulk port-in API. All parameters except for the URL parameter "accountId" are optional in the bulk port-in, although the rules for individual child port-ins described in the /portins API still apply to the child port-ins that make up the bulk port-in. Enforcement of required fields in the child port-ins occurs when the bulk port-in is submitted (i.e. changed from a DRAFT status to IN_PROGRESS). Only fields that you wish to use as defaults for all of the child port-in orders should be included in the bulk port-in order. The child port-ins are also created in DRAFT status, allowing you to update fields that need to be different for each child order before the child orders are submitted.


| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                       |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| `accountId (URL Parameter)` | The account ID for porting the numbers. |
| `CustomerOrderId`       | Internal customer order id for tracking the order. This can be any alphanumeric string. |
| `RequestedFocDate`            | If present this will specify the date and time that the port-in is requested to happen. The actual time and date is subject to negotiation with the losing carriers. Format is ISO8601 encoding of ZULU/UTC/GMT such as “2013-05-10T15:14:22Z”.|
| `AlternateSpid`                 | Unique customer AltSPID to be applied to the port-in requests. Can be changed only for DRAFT bulk port-in. |
| `BillingTelephoneNumber (BTN)`  | Account or Billing telephone number for order. This will be unusual for bulk port-in requests that are expected to decompose into port-in requests from multiple carriers, because the value will be different for each losing carrier. |
| `SubscriberType`                | (BUSINESS, RESIDENTIAL) If residential, order will be rejected if a BusinessName is entered. |
| `BusinessName`                 | Subscriber business name. |
| `FirstName`                 | Subscriber first name. |
| `MiddleInitial`                 | Subscriber middle initial. |
| `LastName`                 | Subscriber last name. |
| `HouseNumber`                 | Street address number. |
| `HousePrefix`                 | Street address number prefix. |
| `HouseSuffix`                 | Street address number suffix. |
| `PreDirectional`                 | Street address pre-directional. |
| `StreetName`                 | Street name. |
| `StreetSuffix`                 | Street suffix. |
| `PostDirectional`                 | Street address post directional. |
| `AddressLine2`                 | Put unit, suite, floor, etc. here. |
| `City`                 | City. |
| `StateCode`                 | Two letter state code. |
| `Zip`                 | Zip code. |
| `PlusFour`                 | Zip + 4 value.|
| `Country`                 | 3 letter country code. |
| `LoaAuthorizingPerson`                 | First and last name of person who authorized LOA. |
| `AccountNumber`                 | Account number associated with the account on the losing carrier, often required for wireless ports, or enterprise ports. This will be unusual for bulk port-in requests that are expected to decompose into port-in requests from multiple carriers. |
| `PinNumber`                 | PIN Number, often required for wireless ports. |
| `siteid`                 | This is the Site / Sub-Account ID made visible in the /accounts/{accountId}/sites API call |
| `PeerId`                 | This is the SIP Peer / Location ID made visible in the /accounts/{accountId}/sites/{siteId}/sipPeers API call |
| `TnAttributes`                 | Attributes to be assigned to the telephone number. Optional parameter. Possible values - "Protected" |
