The Bandwidth Phone Number API is used to submit Port-In requests. These requests to move phone numbers from a “losing carrier” to Bandwidth are part of the Local Number Portability (LNP) process. These LNP requests are automatically validated and processed.

## Cancel a Portin Order

The API allows a user to cancel an existing LNP order. The order number that was generated in the create request must be provided, and dhe status of the order shall not be marked as `COMPLETE`. The <Highlight color="#ff6f47">DELETE</Highlight> method is used for this purpose.

### Request URL
