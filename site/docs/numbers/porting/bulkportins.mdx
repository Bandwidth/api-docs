[The bulkPortins endpoint](/apis/numbers#operation/ListBulkPortins) is used to manage requests to port a diverse collection of Telephone Numbers into the Bandwidth Dashboard. These telephone numbers will be decomposed into a set of individual port-in orders based on port-type, losing carrier, losing RespOrg, etc., making all reasonable attempts to treat the individual port-in requests in a uniform manner. Like many other requests, the bulkPortins endpoint causes the creation of a Bulk Portins order that is used to manage the porting event throughout the lifecycle of the request.

When a bulk port-in is created successfully, it will have one or more child port-in orders that satisfy the following industry port-in rules:

* Telephone numbers in a child port-in order all have the same port-type (e.g. toll free, automated on-net, automated off-net, internal, etc.).
* Non-toll free telephone numbers in a child port-in order all have the same losing carrier.
* Toll free telephone numbers in a child port-in order all have the same losing RespOrg.

The elements used or supplied in the bulk port-in payload are described in the table below. The values supplied in the bulk port-in payload are cascaded to the child port-in orders when possible. This is useful, for example, if you want all of the child orders to have the same CustomerOrderId, or RequestedFocDate.

All bulk port-ins start in a draft processing status and remain in a draft state until explicitly submitted
by setting the bulk port-in ProcessingStatus to IN_PROGRESS. The bulk order starts in “DRAFT” state until
telephone numbers are added using the /tnList endpoint. Once telephone numbers are added, the order
transitions to VALIDATE_DRAFT_TNS, and from there to either VALID_DRAFT_TNS, or INVALID_DRAFT_TNS.
If there are invalid, or non-portable telephone numbers, a GET on [/tnList](/apis/numbers/#operation/ListBulkTns) will show the errors. If all
telephone numbers are portable, child port-in orders are created to handle the actual port-ins.

A bulk port-in order may have one of 3 terminal processing statuses: COMPLETED, CANCELLED, or PARTIAL, which are just an aggregation of the child order statuses. An order in a “terminal” state will never transition to any other processing status (terminal or not). A bulk port-in order goes to a terminal status automatically as soon as the last of its associated child port-ins transfers to terminal status (COMPLETE or CANCELLED). The resulting terminal processing status of the bulk port-in order depends on statuses of associated child port-ins: COMPLETED - when all child port-ins are in COMPLETE status, CANCELLED - when all child port-ins are in CANCELLED status, PARTIAL - when there is a mix of CANCELLED and COMPLETE child port-in statuses.

The following table describes parameters for the bulk port-in API. All parameters except for the URL parameter "accountId" are optional in the bulk port-in, although the rules for individual child port-ins described in the  [/portins](/apis/numbers/#operation/ListPortins)  API still apply to the child port-ins that make up the bulk port-in. Enforcement of required fields in the child port-ins occurs when the bulk port-in is submitted (i.e. changed from a DRAFT status to IN_PROGRESS). Only fields that you wish to use as defaults for all of the child port-in orders should be included in the bulk port-in order. The child port-ins are also created in DRAFT status, allowing you to update fields that need to be different for each child order before the child orders are submitted.
