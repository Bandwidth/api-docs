[The bulkPortins endpoint](/apis/numbers#operation/CreateBulkPortin) is used to manage requests to port a diverse collection of Telephone Numbers into the Bandwidth Dashboard. These telephone numbers will be decomposed into a set of individual port-in orders based on port-type, losing carrier, losing RespOrg, etc., making all reasonable attempts to treat the individual port-in requests in a uniform manner. The elements supplied in the bulk port-in payload are cascaded to the child port-in orders when possible. This is useful, for example, if you want all of the child orders to have the same CustomerOrderId, or RequestedFocDate.

## Submit Bulk Port-in

On this step we assume that you have created your bulk port-in and added telephone numbers which you wanted to port into the Bandwidth Dashboard. If not, follow the [How to create Bulk Port in](/docs/numbers/guides/porting/createBulkPortins) guide.

The bulk port-in and child port-in orders will remain in draft states until you submit them. You can submit all the port-ins together under the umbrella of the bulk port-in by changing bulk port-in status to ```IN_PROGRESS```.

:::info
If for any reason you want to work with individual port-ins you still can submit them separately through ```PUT``` request to [/portins/{orderId} API](/apis/numbers/#operation/UpdatePortin). Check [Update Port-in](/docs/numbers/guides/porting/updatePortin) guide to learn more.
:::

To trigger Bulk Port-in processing use the ```PATCH``` operation on the bulk port-in order to change the ```ProcessingStatus``` to ```IN_PROGRESS```. To do it you must send a <Highlight color="#652B51">PATCH</Highlight> request to our [API /bulkPortins/{orderId}](/apis/numbers/#operation/PatchBulkPortin) endpoint. This can be done through tools like Postman, or in command line.

:::caution
Changing the ProcessingStatus to 'IN_PROGRESS' is only valid if child port-ins exist for the bulk port-in. Check [How to Provide telephone number(s) to port](/docs/numbers/guides/porting/createBulkPortins/#provide-telephone-numbers-to-port) guide.

## Bulk Port-in completion

A bulk port-in order may have one of 3 terminal processing statuses: ```COMPLETED```, ```CANCELLED```, or ```PARTIAL```, which are just an aggregation of the child order statuses. An order in a “terminal” state will never transition to any other processing status (terminal or not). A bulk port-in order goes to a terminal status automatically as soon as the last of its associated child port-ins transfers to terminal status (```COMPLETE``` or ```CANCELLED```). The resulting terminal processing status of the bulk port-in order depends on statuses of associated child port-ins:
* ```COMPLETED``` - when all child port-ins are in ```COMPLETE``` status
* ```CANCELLED``` - when all child port-ins are in ```CANCELLED``` status
* ```PARTIAL``` - when there is a mix of ```CANCELLED``` and ```COMPLETE``` child port-in statuses.
