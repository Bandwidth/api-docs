  <tr>
   <td>Actual FOC date
   </td>
   <td>Once the losing carrier has been informed about a port, and they’ve agreed on the date (and possibly time) that the numbers can be ported, the negotiated date is referred to as the actual FOC date.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Automated (Port Type)
   </td>
   <td>An automated port is processed by Bandwidth sending an API call to our on-net or off-net porting vendor to process the port-in.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Carrier
   </td>
   <td>A carrier is a telephony network provider.  The carrier provides the physical network (IP or PSTN) for your telephone calls.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Controlling RespOrg
   </td>
   <td>The RespOrg that is currently responsible for a toll free number.  For porting, the controlling RespOrg is the RespOrg that the number is being ported from.  See also, Target RespOrg.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Draft Port-in
   </td>
   <td>A port-in or bulk port-in may be created as a “draft”.  This allows information to be added to the draft as it becomes available, without involving the SUPP process, until the draft is submitted.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Earliest Estimate
   </td>
   <td>Once a port-in has been categorized into a port type and the losing carrier has been determined, the order will have an earliest-estimate date.  This date is Bandwidth’s estimate of the earliest requested FOC date that is not likely to be rejected for being too soon.

  <tr>
   <td>Internal (Port Type)
   </td>
   <td>An internal port-in is one in which telephone numbers that are already on Bandwidth’s network are ported from one Bandwidth customer to another Bandwidth customer.  For the winning account, it is a port-in.  For the losing account, it is a port-out.
