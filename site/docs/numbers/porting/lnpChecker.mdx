For a smoother porting experience, you can check to see if your numbers are portable to the Bandwidth Network, before submitting a port order.
:::info
The `/bulkPortins` API eliminates the need for the `/lnpchecker` API by sorting the list of TNs automatically into a set of port-in requests by Port Type. For more details follow the [How to Bulk Port](/docs/numbers/guides/porting/createBulkPortins/).
:::

For all TNs in a `/portins` request, all of the following must be true:

1. They all have the same Port Type (see the `Port Types` section below)
2. They all have the same losing carrier (toll free telephone numbers all have the same losing RespOrg)
3. They are all associated with the same billing TN and Service Address

### Port Types

Port Type is a categorization of how the TNs submitted to the /lnpchecker API will be handled by Bandwidth.

| Port Type       | Description                               |                                   |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| MANUAL | `MANUAL` (for all port types starting with `MANUAL`) indicates that if the TNs cannot be ported automatically, the Bandwidth LNP team will work with the appropriate porting vendor or losing carrier to ensure completion of the port-in. The /portins API can be used to submit manual port-ins, which will be identified as such, and a support ticket will be automatically created to notify the Bandwidth LNP team. |
| MANUALOFFNET | `Off-net` means that the telephone numbers in the port-in exist in a rate center supported by one of Bandwidth’s partners. Off-net port-ins are processed manually when the Bandwidth partner does not have APIs by which the port-in can be automated, or Bandwidth has not implemented those APIs. Orders may also be processed manually if there are more numbers in the port-in than the partner’s interface supports, e.g. off-net ports with vendor Level 3 and with more than 49 TNs are automatically submitted as manual ports.|
| MANUALONNET | `On-net` means that the telephone numbers in the port-in exist in a rate center supported by Bandwidth. On-net port-ins are processed manually only when there are more numbers in the port-in than the porting vendor’s interface supports (e.g more than 999 TNs). |
| MANUALTOLLFREE | Currently all toll free port-ins are handled manually by Bandwidth’s LNP team. But Bandwidth is in the process of automating portions of toll free porting, with a goal of eventually automating the entire process. |
| AUTOMATED | If the TNs are on-net, or off-net and covered by a Bandwidth partner that supports automated ports, then the port-in of these TNs will be handled with no human intervention using interfaces to our porting vendors. There are several sub-types of `AUTOMATED` as follows: <br/><ul><li>`AUTOMATED` - means that the telephone numbers in the port-in exist in a rate center supported by Bandwidth (On-net tns). There are differences in on-net port-in rules depending on whether the order is for wireless to wireless vs. one of the other 3 combinations.</li><li>`AUTOMATEDOFFNET` - Off-net means that the telephone numbers in the port-in exist in a rate center supported by one of Bandwidth’s partners. Currently, only numbers in the U.S. are automated. There are differences in port-in rules depending on whether the order has achieved FOC status.</li><li>`INTERNAL` - Internal means that the telephone number is being moved from one Bandwidth account to another Bandwidth account. Internal port-in may involve on-net, off-net, or toll free telephone numbers.</li></ul>|
| MIXED | If the list of TNs supplied to /lnpchecker includes TNs that are categorized as more than one of the above Port Types, the resulting Port Type will be `MIXED`. If you plan to use /portins to port the TNs, you must break the TN list into separate /portins requests for each Port Type. |

### Check number(s) portability

A number or set of numbers can be checked to see if they can be ported into the Bandwidth Network using the <Highlight color="#079CEE">POST</Highlight> request to [`/accounts/{accountId}/lnpChecker`](/apis/numbers#operation/RequestPortabilityInfo/) API endpoint. This can be done using tools like Postman or cURL.

:::caution
There are some cases that you won't be able to port-in a TN:

* The TN is in a rate center that is not supported by Bandwidth or any of Bandwidth's partners.
* The TN is an off-net TN, and the account is configured to support tier zero (on-net) only.
* The TN belongs to a losing carrier with whom Bandwidth does not have a Trading Partner Agreement.
* The TN is already being processed in another active port-in order.
* The Bandwidth account has not been enabled for porting.
Otherwise, the user must separate the TNs into individual `/portins` requests.
