The Bandwidth numbers API allows you to automate the creation and download of certain reports related to account usage. This is handled through various requests to our `/reports` and `/billingReports` endpoints. The available reports for each endpoint are detailed in their respective sections.

## Account Reports

A <Highlight color="#00bf8c">GET</Highlight> request to `https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/reports` will return an XML list of the available report types, their ID number, and a description of each. The report ID needs to be passed in to the URL of the API request to indicate which type of report we want to create.

A <Highlight color="#00bf8c">GET</Highlight> request to `https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/reports/{reportId}` will return details for a specific report, like a description and the parameters needed to define boundaries for the report.

### Request a Report {#request-billing-report}
Creating a report starts with a <code class="post">POST</code> request to `https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/billingReports`, detailing the date range for the report as well as type of report you wish to download. A successful response will include a body and location header, which contains a URI with the report ID to be used in later requests.

> Request

```xml
POST https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/billingReports HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=

<BillingReport>

    <DateRange>

        <EndDate>2020-05-29</EndDate>
    </DateRange>
</BillingReport>
```
> Response

```xml
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8

<BillingReportCreationResponse>
    <ReportStatus>RECEIVED</ReportStatus>
    <Description>The report archive is currently being constructed.</Description>
</BillingReportCreationResponse>
```

### Query Report Status {#status-billing-report}
Because of the asynchronous nature of the `/billingReports` endpoint, a <code class="post">POST</code> request does not necessarily mean the report is ready to be consumed. A <code class="get">GET</code> request to the URI received in the location header will return the report status, letting us know if it is ready to be downloaded or not. Expected responses in the `<ReportStatus>` element are `PROCESSING` and `COMPLETED`.

> Request

```http
GET https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/billingreports/a12b456c8-abcd-1a3b-a1b2-0a2b4c6d8e0f2 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
> Response

```xml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8

<BillingReportRetrievalResponse>
    <ReportStatus>COMPLETED</ReportStatus>
    <Description>The report archive is constructed.</Description>
</BillingReportRetrievalResponse>
```

### Download the Report {#download-billing-report}
Once the report status query returns `COMPLETED`, we are ready to download the requested report. This can be done by making a <code class="get">GET</code> request to the URI received in the location header of the response to our original <code class="post">POST</code> request, and appending it with `/file` . The 200 response will include a `Content-Disposition` header indicating the filename, and a download of the .zip file will begin.

> Request

```http
GET https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/billingreports/a12b456c8-abcd-1a3b-a1b2-0a2b4c6d8e0f2/file HTTP/1.1
