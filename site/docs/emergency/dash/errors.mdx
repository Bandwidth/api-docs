## Throttling and Request Rate Limitation

We ask our customers to self-limit requests to 3 per second. By default, Bandwidth will automatically limit requests for some resource-intensive API operations to 5 requests per second so that the activities of one customer don't impact other customers. The operations that are throttled are:

  * [validateLocation](/apis/dash#operation/validateLocation)
  * [addLocation](/apis/dash#operation/addLocation)
  * [provisionLocation](/apis/dash#operation/provisionLocation)
  * [removeLocation](/apis/dash#operation/removeLocation)
  * [removeUri](/apis/dash#operation/removeUri)

Both SOAP and REST versions of these operations are rate-limited.

We may throttle other operations if we identify traffic that appears to be abusive. Requests that violate the rate limits will receive an HTTP 429 response. Please open a ticket with your Bandwidth Support Team if you believe you need a higher rate limit.
