Bandwidth uses HTTP Callbacks webhooks to send events to any publicly addressable url, as defined in your messaging [application](/docs/account/applications).

## Overview

  * All Message callbacks are sent as a list/array `[ {message metadata} ]` to the webhook url in the application.
  * You **MUST** Reply with a `HTTP 2xx` status code for _every_ callback/delivery receipt.  Bandwidth will retry _every_ callback over the next 24 hours until a `HTTP 2xx` code is received for the callback.  After 24 hours, Bandwidth will no longer try to send the callback
  * Bandwidth's Messaging platform has a 10 second timeout for callbacks. This means your server must respond to the callback request within 10 seconds, otherwise the platform will try again at a later time.
  * Because we guarantee "at least once delivery" of events, it is possible (but not common) to receive duplicate message events. Your server should be able to handle duplicates.

## Inbound Message Webhooks

For incoming messages sent to your numbers, a callback will also be received, notifying your [Application](/docs/account/applications) of the incoming message. For group messages where you own multiple recipient phone numbers, you will receive a distinct event and `messageId` for each individual recipient.

In order to receive text messages events, you need to ensure you have set up your application to send callbacks to your server's URL

When sending to Group Messages, there is a maximum of 10 participants in a Group.

**For inbound messages**, we do not limit the amount of recipients. We will pass along any messages we receive, **even if there are more than 10 recipients**.
If you wanted to reply to all `9+{n}` recipients using V2 APIs, Bandwidth will reply with a 400 error (as you are limited to 10 recipients when sending outbound). You will need to break up the responses into separate messages to respond to more than `9+{n}` participants

## Outbound Message Webhooks

Callbacks will be sent via an HTTP POST request to the Callback URL for the [Application](/docs/account/applications) associated with the `applicationId` field sent with the [send message](/docs/messaging/createMessage) payload. You will get a callback for any event related to that message.
  * For example, you will get an HTTP callback when your message is delivered, or blocked. In addition, you will get an event for any kind of Delivery Receipt that the destination carrier sends back, regarding the delivery of your message.

For each outbound message, you **will** receive either (but not both) a `Message Delivered` or `Message Failed` event.
  * It is essential to check the direction of the message in the callback you receive. For example, if your use case depends on responding to inbound messages, you do not want to respond to an outbound message callback. This could create a loop of messages being sent from your account as you continuously respond to outbound message callbacks.

Delivery receipts are now supported for MMS & Group Messaging. During this beta phase, you will need to request this functionality to be enabled on your account. Once enabled you will need to support all three possible callback events for MMS (Message Delivered, Message Failed, & Message Queued callbacks). [Visit our Support Site](https://support.bandwidth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051643414-How-do-I-enable-MMS-Delivery-Receipts-when-sending-messages-) to learn more about enabling MMS DLR on your account.

### Message Sending

You will receive this callback between when the message is received by Bandwidth and the terminal events (message delivered, message failed) for MMS only if you have the `Feature_MMS_DLR` feature flag enabled.

### Message Delivered

MMS and Group messages do currently support delivery receipts. However, you will need to have this enabled. Without the delivery receipts enabled, you will still receive a message delivered event when the message is sent. The message delivered event will not represent true delivery for only MMS and Group Messages. This will mean your message has been handed off to the Bandwidth's MMSC network, but has not been confirmed at the downstream carrier.

### Message Failed

For MMS and Group Messages, you will only receive this callback if you have enabled delivery receipts on MMS.

Toll free phone numbers support "device-level" delivery receipts which indicate that the end-users **device** has received the message.

A timeout response with error-code: **9902 - Timed out waiting for delivery receipt. The reason a delivery receipt was not received is not known.** does **not** indicate that the message was not received. Only that the end-users' device did not communicate back to the network indicating the message was received during the DLR timeout window.

A DLR when the **from** number is **toll-free** and the **status** is **ok** indicates that the message was indeed delivered to the end users' device.
