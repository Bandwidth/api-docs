The Bandwidth Messaging API will report delivery outbound errors via [Webhooks](/docs/messaging/webhooks/) and message creation errors via the HTTP status codes.

## HTTP Status Codes

Bandwidth will respond with HTTP errors code when the message creation request fails. Any `4xx` or `5xx` HTTP response code will not be billed nor will the message be sent.

## Messaging Errors

The Bandwidth V2 messaging API presents errors to your Webhook URL using the [`message-failed`](/docs/messaging/webhooks#message-failed/) type in the payload body along with an `errorCode` and `description`.

### Error Code Schema

Bandwidthâ€™s error code schema for messaging V2 is comprised of a 4 digit code.  As shown in the table below, the most significant digit indicates whether the error is client (customer) or server in nature while the second most significant indicates whether the error was reported by Bandwidth or the downstream carrier. The last 2 are Bandwidth specific codes or bandwidth normalization of carrier specific codes.

### Bandwidth Detected Client Errors

A 4xxx code indicates that Bandwidth or the downstream carrier has identified some element of the message request unacceptable.  Repeating the request will produce the same result.

| Code | Description | Friendly Description | Explanation Of Error | Billable |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 4001 | service-not-allowed | Message was rejected for reasons other than those covered by other 4xxx codes | This is a general error that the service you are attempting to use is not allowed; you may have inaccurate permissions, formatting or may not be enable to use that service. | NO |
| 4301 | malformed-invalid-encoding | Malformed message encoding | The message contains invalid characters that are not supported. Bandwidth cannot re-encode message for destination.  | NO |
| 4302 | malformed-invalid-from-number | Malformed From number | The From number associated with the message is a number not routable to a carrier or valid in the industry (Ex: a 9 digit number).  | NO |
| 4303 | malformed-invalid-to-number | Malformed To Number | The To number associated with the message is a number not routable to a carrier or valid in the industry (Ex: a 9 digit number).  | NO |
| 4350 | malformed-for-destination | Malformed message encoding | Message passed validation on receive stage, but failed on send. This is likely because the destination number (To) is an invalid number. | NO |
| 4360 | message-not-sent-expiration-date-passed | Message expired | Message was not sent because the specified expiration date passed before the message was able to send | NO |
| 4401 | rejected-routing-error | BW is unable to route the message | Message is unable to be routed within Bandwidth particularly when the source and destination are the same number. The destination or To number is mis-provisioned or there is a configuration with the message that is causing a situation where a message is being sent repeatedly between the same numbers. | NO |
| 4403 | rejected-forbidden-from-number | Messaging forbidden on From number | Messaging on this From number is forbidden most commonly because the number does not belong to BW or the account.

| 4740 | invalid-source-address-address | Carrier Rejected as Invalid Source Address | Carrier is rejecting the message due to invalid source address - the number does not exist in the numbering plan. Other reasons for this error code is the source carrier is invalid or disabled or source not authorized or the number type is not supported.  | YES |
| 4750 | destination-rejected-message | Carrier Rejected Message | The destination carrier has rejected the message but provided no specific reason.  For AT&T traffic, this could be a prepaid user whose account is out of money, a subscriber that is provisioned to not receive this type of SMS or it was identified as Spam | YES |
| 4751 | destination-rejected-message-size-invalid | Message is too long or message length is invalid for the carrier. | Carrier has rejected for message length is invalid or too long.  | YES |
| 4752 | destination-rejected-malformed | Message is malformed for the carrier. | Carrier is rejecting the message malformed; this could be because of a blank message, unacceptable data value, the receiving SMSC or SME does not accept messages with more than 160 characters, syntax error, content is invalid, message ID is invalid, invalid parameter length, expected TLV missing, invalid TLV value, invalid data coding scheme, invalid number of destinations, error in the optional part of the PDU body, TLV not allowed, or XML validation error. | YES |
| 4753 | destination-rejected-handset | The destination handset has rejected the message | The handset has rejected the message | YES |

### Bandwidth Service Failures

A 5xx code indicates that either Bandwidth or the downstream carrier has reported a service failure.   For Bandwidth failures, the customer can retry the request and expect a different result.   For carrier errors a retry may also yield a different result however the customer should limit to a single retry attempt as the error encoding schema and strategy varies greatly by carrier and while Bandwidth endeavors to normalize carrier codes into predictable values there can be exceptions.
