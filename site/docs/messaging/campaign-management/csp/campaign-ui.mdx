This walks through how to provision, manage and view your campaigns through the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com) for use with our [Campaign](./campaign-api), [Number Management](../../../numbers) and [Messaging](../../../messaging) API's.

## Assumptions

While provisioning your campaigns through Bandwidth Dashboard UI, they will automatically provision to all participating carriers.

## Register a campaign
Once you log into the Bandwidth Dashboard, you should see **Campaigns** in the navigation bar. 
If you select it, you will be routed to the **Brands** sub navigation. From there you can select the **Campaigns** sub navigation
which is where you will see a list of the campaigns that have been previously registered on your account. <br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/campaign-list-new.png').default}
/>
<br/>

If you have not previously registered a campaign you will see **CREATE A NEW CAMPAIGN**. 
If you select **CREATE A NEW CAMPAIGN** or **+ NEW CAMPAIGN** you will be prompted with the campaign registration form.<br/>

The first section is where you will select the brand you want to associate with the campaign.<br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/register-campaign-brand-section.png').default}
/>
<br/>

The second section is where you will select the campaign use case(s).<br/>

### Standard use case
For standard use cases, you only need to select one to proceed to the next section.<br/>
<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/register-campaign-usecase-standard.png').default}
/>
<br/>

### Mixed use case
For mixed use cases (Mixed or Low Volume Mixed), once selected, you will see sub-use cases display below. You must select two or more to continue to the next section.<br/>
<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/register-campaign-usecase-mixed.png').default}
/>
<br/>

### Special use case
Special use cases are on the right side of the form. These use cases need to go through MNO manual approval processes and may not be approved for some time after registering.<br/>

The third and final section is where you will enter the campaign details.<br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/register-campaign-details-1.png').default}
/>
<br/>
<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/register-campaign-details-2.png').default}
/>
<br/>

## Campaign List
Once you successfully register a campaign, you will be navigated back to the campaign list page<br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/campaign-list.png').default}
/>
<br/>

### Campaign Statuses
While on the campaign list page, you will be able to view the statuses of you campaigns<br/>

#### Campaign Status
The campaign statuses are - 1)ACTIVE or 2)EXPIRED. Immediately after registering a campaign, it will be in the ACTIVE status. 
A campaign will only become EXPIRED if you take the action to deactivate the campaign yourself, or if auto-renewal is turned off for the campaign.<br/>

#### MNO Status
The MNO (carrier) statuses are - 1)REVIEW, 2)APPROVED, 3)REJECTED, or 4)SUSPENDED. For standard use cases, immediately after registering a campaign, all MNO statuses will be APPROVED. 
For special use cases, all mno statuses will be REVIEW, and is subject to a manual review process. An MNO Can suspend and/or unsuspend a campaign at any time at their own discretion. <br/>

_Note_: 
1) Campaign Status and MNO Statuses are entirely independent of each other. 
A campaign can be in ACTIVE status, but still be in REVIEW, REJECTED, or SUSPENDED by one or more MNOs.
2) If a campaign has an EXPIRED status or if any of the MNO statuses are not APPROVED, then the campaign cannot be associated to a TN in our system.
If a campaign has already been associated to TN(s), and the campaign becomes EXPIRED or an MNO suspends the campaign, it will be removed from those TN(s).<br/>

### Error Messages
We have some asynchronous processing that happens behind the scenes after registering a campaign. 
In the event of a processing delay, the campaign in question will have an error message displayed next to it on the campaign list page. 
Processing should be complete within one hour. If a campaign is seeing a processing delay, it will not be eligible to be assigned to a tn until it is resolved.<br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/campaign-list-error.png').default}

<br/>

## View Campaign Details
While on the list page, you can click on a Campaign ID to navigate to the campaign details page. Here you can view the Carrier Term Preview, and associated campaign information.<br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/campaign-details-1.png').default}
/>
<br/>
<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/campaign-details-2.png').default}
/>
<br/>

## Edit Campaign
You can edit your campaign by selecting the **EDIT CAMPAIGN** button from the details page. The only fields that are editable are - Sample 1-5 and Auto-Renewal<br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/edit-campaign.png').default}
/>
<br/>
<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/edit-campaign-2.png').default}
/>
<br/>

## Deactivate Campaign
You can deactivate your campaign by selecting the **DEACTIVATE CAMPAIGN** button from the details page. <br/>

You will be prompted with a warning message and have the ability to confirm the action. This action cannot be reversed. 
Deactivating a campaign will change the Campaign Status to EXPIRED, and will remove the campaign from all TNs in our system. <br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/deactivate-campaign-warning.png').default}
/>
<br/>

Campaigns in EXPIRED status cannot be edited or deactivated.<br/>

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/deactivated-campaign.png').default}
/>
<br/>

## Assign a campaign to a TN

You should see **Numbers** in the navigation bar. 
If you select it, you will be routed to a sub navigation where you will see **My Numbers**.
If you select it, you can search for a TN and view the details page.

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/tn-option-order-1.png').default}
/>
<br/>

Once on the TN details page, you can scroll to the bottom where you will see SMS Settings. 
Ensure SMS Settings is on, and that use location defaults is off. 
You will see a dropdown labeled **A2P Campaign ID**. 
Your campaigns will be found in the dropdown. 
When you select a Campaign ID the **Message Class** field will auto-populate with the message class assigned from TCR.
When you click the **Save** button, the TN will be associated with the Campaign ID and will be ready for use.<br/>

_Note_: 
If you don't see the Campaign ID in the dropdown, it's likely that - 
1) it has not been approved by all Mobile Network Operators (MNOs),
2) it has been deactivated and is in EXPIRED status
3) background processing has been delayed for your campaign. This should be resolved within 1 hour of initial registration.<br/>
For a full list of status values and descriptions, please see [our campaign FAQs](./faq) <br/>

<br/> 
  
<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/tn-option-order-3.png').default}
/>
<br/>

_Note_: 
If you are not able to turn location defaults off, you will need to reach out to the implementation team to disable 'Enforce Location Long Code Settings' on your locations. - <br/>

## Bulk Assign a campaign to multiple TNs
You should see **Numbers** in the navigation bar. 
If you select it, you will be routed to a sub navigation where you will see **Upload Line Features**.
If you select it, you will see the **Choose a .csv file to import** field.

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/tn-bulk-upload-1.png').default}
/>
<br/>

Sample CSV format is as follows - [Downloadable Sample](../../../../static/csv/tn_option_order_sample.csv)

| TN <br/> TN       | A2pSettings <br/> CampaignId   | A2pSettings <br/> Action      | 
|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| `9192491000`      | `CABCDEF`         | `asSpecified`     |
| `9192491001`      | `CEFGHIJ`         | `asSpecified`     |
| `9192491002`      | `C0123456`        | `asSpecified`     |

Once you click the **Import** button the TNs will be processed. 
Upon successful completion, the TNs will have the appropriate Campaign ID assigned and will be ready for use.

## Next steps
### Create an API-only user
Create an [API-only user](../../../account/credentials) to validate your API calls. Unlike user accounts that can access the Bandwidth Dashboard User Interface, users restricted to API only access won’t require periodic password resets.

### Start developing to our Messaging APIs
After you've finished registering your campaigns, explore our inventory and order a phone number to your account. Once you have a phone number, you are ready to [send your first text message](../../../messaging/createMessage). For help, check out our [SDK’s and Postman Collection](../../../../sdks).
