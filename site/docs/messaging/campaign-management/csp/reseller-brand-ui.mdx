## Register your brand
Once you log into the Bandwidth Dashboard, you should see **Campaigns** in the navigation bar. 
If you select it and you have not yet registered your brand, you will be directed to the landing page.

<br/>

Once on the landing page, if you select **REGISTER MY BRAND** you will be prompted with a pop-up modal with a series of forms to register your 1) reseller if necessary and 2) brand.

/>
<br/>

The first section is where you will enter your brand details. Once you enter all the required information, you can hit next to go to the Brand Contact Details section.<br/>

### Direct Customer
If you are a direct customer and will not be managing brands and campaigns for other companies, you can select the Direct Customer option and submit the form to register your brand.

/>
<br/>

### Reseller
If you are a reseller, you can select the Reseller option and enter the required information to submit and register your reseller and brand.

/>
<br/>

## Brand List
After successful registration of your brand, you will be directed to the Brand List page. If you are a Direct Customer, you will only be able to see your brand. 
If you are a Reseller, you will see your Customer Brand list in addition to your brand.<br/>

/>
<br/>

## Register Customer Brands
If you are a reseller, you can add as many customer brands as you would like. 
From the brand list page if you select the **ADD CUSTOMER BRAND** button, you will be prompted again with the Brand Details form.<br/>

/>
<br/>

## Edit Brands
You can edit both your brand, and your customer brands by hitting the **EDIT** button next to the brand you would like to update. 
Select Brand fields are editable once they have been registered, and may trigger a re-score of the brand from TCR. <br/>

## Next steps
### Register Campaigns
After registering your brand(s) you can use them to [register campaigns](./campaign-ui).

### Create an API-only user
Create an [API-only user](../../../account/credentials) to validate your API calls. Unlike user accounts that can access the Bandwidth Dashboard User Interface, users restricted to API only access won’t require periodic password resets.

### Start developing to our Messaging APIs
After you've finished importing your campaigns, explore our inventory and order a phone number to your account. Once you have a phone number, you are ready to [send your first text message](../../../messaging/createMessage). For help, check out our [SDK’s and Postman Collection](/sdks).
