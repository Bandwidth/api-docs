## Viewing Brand Details

First click on the *Campaigns* section and ensure you are on the *Brands* list section.

/>
<br/>

From here you can navigate to a brand's details by clicking it on the list.
All vetting functionality lives on this page.

/>
<br/>

## Request Brand Re-vet
If you have already created a brand, but it received a status of unverified, you are able to request a re-vet. Please note that there is a fee associated with re-vetting.
First, navigate to the brand details page [as shown above](#view-brand-details).

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/brand-details-page-revet.png').default}
/>
<br/>

On this page you should now see a *Revet* button next to the identity status of the brand if it is unverified.
When you click this you will be presented with a confirm dialogue.

<img
 src={require('../../../../static/img/brand-revet-confirm.png').default}
/>
<br/>

If you confirm the re-vet submission your brand will be submitted to be re-vetted.


## Request External Vetting
You are able to request external vetting to be done on your brand for a fee.
First, navigate to the brand details page [as shown above](#view-brand-details).

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/brand-details-page-request-vetting.png').default}
/>
<br/>

You should be able to see *Apply For Vetting* as an option above the external vetting record list. When clicked, you will see the following modal.

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/brand-request-vetting-modal.png').default}
/>
<br/>

Please note that at the moment only AEGIS is applicable when requesting vetting.
Once you've selected your provider and input the type of vetting, hit submit to request the vetting.
It will then show your request within the external vetting list.


## Import External Vetting Record
In order to import an external vetting record you previously made into our system, first navigate to the brand details page [as shown above](#view-brand-details).
You should be able to see *Import Vetting* as an option above the external vetting record list.

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/brand-details-page-import-vetting.png').default}
/>
<br/>

When you click this, a modal will come up allowing you to input information regarding the vetting record you are importing.

<img
  src={require('../../../../static/img/brand-external-vetting-import-modal.png').default}
/>
<br/>

Once submitted, your import will now show in the external vetting record list.


## Next steps
### Register Campaigns
After registering your brand(s) you can use them to [register campaigns](./campaign-ui).

### Create an API-only user
Create an [API-only user](../../../account/credentials) to validate your API calls. Unlike user accounts that can access the Bandwidth Dashboard User Interface, users restricted to API only access won’t require periodic password resets.

### Start developing to our Messaging APIs
After you've finished importing your campaigns, explore our inventory and order a phone number to your account. Once you have a phone number, you are ready to [send your first text message](../../../messaging/createMessage). For help, check out our [SDK’s and Postman Collection](/sdks).
