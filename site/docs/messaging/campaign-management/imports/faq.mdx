## 1. What is the difference between the 'status', and the 'mnoStatusList' field?
The 'status' field is the status of the campaign from the TCR perspective. 
The 'mnoStatusList' field, is a list of statuses from the individual carrier perspective. Both sets of statuses are entirely independent. 
It is possible to have a campaign that is in 'ACTIVE' status from the TCR perspective, but have 'REJECTED' statuses from one or more carriers.

## 2. What are all the possible 'status' field values?
* 'ACTIVE'
* 'EXPIRED'

## 3. What are all the possible 'mnoStatus' field values?
* 'REVIEW'
* 'APPROVED'
* 'REJECTED'
* 'SUSPENDED'

## 4. My campaign has been rejected by one or more carriers, how can I get them to approve?
At this point, the carriers campaign review rules are unknown to Bandwidth. To get your campaign re-reviewed, you will have to update your campaign and re-submit.

## 5. How do I share my campaigns with Bandwidth DCA?
You can share your campaigns with Bandwidth DCA in the TCR UI or by making a request to PUT csp-api.campaignregistry.com/campaign/{campaignId}/sharing/BANDW - For more info, please see the [TCR CSP API Documentation](https://csp-api.campaignregistry.com/v1/restAPI)
