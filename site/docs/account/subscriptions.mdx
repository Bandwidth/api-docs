  Bandwidth uses webhooks to send number management & porting events to any publicly addressable url.

  In order to successfully use the Number Management & Porting APIs you need to configure an `subscription` for each `orderType`. Each subscription is account global and each **account** can have multiple subscriptions per `orderType`.

  Subscriptions contain the `URL` & `CallbackCreds` to authenticate and send events for each state change.

  Because processing times may vary across all order types, Bandwidth recommends the use of subscriptions to receive webhook notifications upon order completion, as opposed to polling the resource ID with <Highlight color="#00bf8c">GET</Highlight> requests until the desired state is returned.
