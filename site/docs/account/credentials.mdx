This guide will cover the creation of an API user and generation of credentials for interacting with Bandwidth's APIs.

## Creating an API User

An account admin is required to create API credentials that allow software developers to authenticate their applications to Bandwidth's APIs.

1. Log into the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/).
2. In the top navigation menu, select **Account** and click **Users**.
3. Click **Add** and go to the **User Information** section.

### User Information

4. Under **Administration level**, select whether the user should be a Basic User or an Account Admin.
    - Basic User: Can only see themselves
    - Account Admin: Can manage all users on shared accounts.
5. Under **User access methods:** choose how the user should be able to use their credentials. 
    - Select **Allow user credentials to authenticate API** to allow this user to use their credentials to authenticate API calls. Since an API user is expected to perform automated processes, they won't be required to reset their password but also won't be able to use these credentials to log into the Bandwidth Dashboard. To address this, many developers choose to have one set of credentials to access the Bandwidth Dashboard and another to validate API calls.

:::note 
You can also check both boxes, but it should only be done in special cases and isn't recommended for most users. Although we don't force password resets for users with API-only or both access methods, we do encourage you to enforce your own automated password reset best practices.

6. A **Username** will be automatically generated for you. Please remember to take note of this and you can change the username if you choose to do so.
7. Enter a first and last name, email address, and work phone number. 
    - The **email address** is critical as this is where the activation email will be sent.
    - The **first name**, **last name** and **work phone number** will be used to validate your API user from the activation email.

:::info
**The email used must be different from your existing dashboard account**. The username can't be changed once the user is created, so please make sure to double-check it before saving. The phone number must be typed in a 10-digit format. Each user will need to verify it using the same exact format.

### Roles

9. **Roles:** Set the permissions for this account. From here, click to toggle the permissions your user will need to access for their job. User role definitions are available below.
    - **Billing Reports** -	Allows user to create and view billing reports.
    - **Campaign Management**	- Allows user to manage campaign provisioning.
    - **Configuration** -	Allows user to configure Sub-accounts and Locations.
    - **Disconnect**	- Allows user to disconnect phone numbers.
    - **E911 Management** -	Allows user to manage E911 settings (applicable for UC accounts).
    - **External TNs** -	Allows user to access external TNs API and UI (applicable for Hosted Messaging).
    - **HTTP Application Management** -	Allows user to manage HTTP applications in the UI (applicable for Messaging API accounts).
    - **HTTP Voice** - Allows user to make HTTP Voice API calls.
    - **Line Features** -	Allows user to manage phone number line features, such as CNAM and DL/DA.
    - **Messaging Insights** -	Allows user to view messaging insights.
    - **Numbers Insights** -	Allows user to view numbers insights.
    - **Ordering** -	Allows user to search and order new phone numbers from Bandwidth's inventory.
    - **Porting**	- Allows user to port phone numbers in and out of their Bandwidth account.
    - **Reporting** -	Allows user to access available reports for their account and create or manage notifications. As long as the product for which the notification is being created is active on the account, an API user can set it up using this process.
    - **SIP Credentials** -	Allows user to view and manage SIP credentials. 
    - **TN Lookup** -	Allows user to access the TN Lookup API. This also requires TN Lookup to be enabled at the account level.
    - **Voice Insights** - Allows user to view voice insights.

11. Click **Save Changes.**

## Activating an API User

By default all API users that are created are inactive. To activate their account you must follow the steps below.

1. Once an API user is created, an email will be sent to the email address specified during account creation.
2. Click the link in the email to verify their account information.
3. Verify the API user information including the first name, last name and work phone number.
4. If a password was not created for this user, they'll receive a second email containing their password.

:::note 
You should be logged out from the dashboard when attempting to activate an API user.

## API Credentials

All of Bandwidth's APIs are protected with Basic Authorization over HTTPS. Basic Authorization requires the user's `username:password` pair to be encoded with [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) as part of the `Authorization` HTTP header from the API user you created.

:::tip
Usernames and Passwords are **case sensitive**!

|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| `username`      | Your API user's **username**                                                                                                                                  | `jdoe`                                             |
| `password`      | Your API user's **password**                                                                                                                                  | `correct-horse-battery-staple`                     |
| `accountId`     | Your unique **account id**. The `accountId` is used as part of the url to make API requests, e.g. `https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/` | `920012`                                           |
