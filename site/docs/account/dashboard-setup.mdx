This walks through how to setup and configure your Bandwidth account through the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com) for use with our [Number Management](../numbers), [HTTP Voice](../voice), and [HTTP Messaging](../messaging) APIs.

Now that we’ve covered the [hierarchical structure](structure.md) of your Bandwidth Dashboard account, let’s talk about how to complete your set-up.

Bandwidth recommends that all new users complete their account set-up using the Bandwidth Dashboard user interface to best get acquainted with our unique account structure.

After you’ve familiarized yourself with these concepts, you may want to automate your set-up and [programmatically configure](programmatic-setup) your Sub-Accounts, Locations & Applications.

## Assumptions
* You have been contracted and given access to your Bandwidth Dashboard Account
* Your account is enabled for HTTP Voice and/or Messaging
* You have administrator access on the account to create users and change roles

## Steps
1. [Create a Sub-Account](#create-a-sub-account-site)
2. [Create a Location](#create-a-location-sip-peer)
1. [Create an Application](#creating-applications)
    * [Create a Voice Application](#create-a-voice-application)
    * [Create a Messaging Application](#create-a-messaging-application)
1. [Order a Phone Number](#order-a-phone-number)
1. [Next steps](#next-steps)
    * [Create an API-only user](#create-an-api-only-user)
    * [Start Developing to Our Voice and Messaging APIs](#start-developing-to-our-voice-and-messaging-apis)

## Create a Sub-Account (Site)
<img

  alt="Account Setup 1"
  class="center"
/>

<br/>Once you log into the Bandwidth Dashboard, the first thing you need to do is set up your initial Sub-account. Metaphorically speaking, if you were to look at the Account as a filing cabinet, the Sub-accounts can be best visualized as the drawers.

:::tip
Many users choose to just keep a single Sub-Account. Whereas others create two to represent Development & Production environments.
:::

  1. In the top navigation bar, click **Account**, select **Sub-accounts**, and then click **Add Sub-account**.
  1. Enter the required information and click **Create Sub-account**.

:::tip
Your Sub-account contains a unique Site ID, you will need to reference this for our Number Management API requests.

## Create a Location (SIP Peer)
<img
  src={require('../../static/img/account-setup-3.png').default}
  alt="Account Setup 3"
  class="center"
/>

A Location is where you’ll link your Application and provision other routing settings. When a phone number is added to a Location, it will inherit the settings and properties of that Location.

Link your Application with a Location:

  1. After you’ve created your Application, navigate to the **Associated Locations** section of the newly created application
  1. Click **Create a Location**.
  1. On the **Locations Settings** page, select a **Sub-Account**.
  1. Type in a **Location Name** and optional description. You’ll order and port phone numbers to a Location. Give it a name that’s easily identifiable.
  1. If there is no default location linked to your chosen sub-account already, enable `Default Location`
  1. Select **Voice Protocol** (HTTP or SIP, if applicable).
      * Note: You need to set voice protocol as `HTTP` to link it to a voice application
  1. Click **SMS Enabled** (if applicable)
      1. Enable **Toll Free** or **Short Code** SMS (if applicable)
      1. Select zones for international messaging (if applicable)
      1. Ensure **SMS protocol** is `HTTP`
      1. Ensure `V2 Messaging` is toggled __ON__
      1. Associate the proper Messaging Application

## Next steps
### Create an API-only User
Create an [API-only user](credentials) to validate your API calls. Unlike user accounts that can access the Bandwidth Dashboard User Interface, users restricted to API only access won’t require periodic password resets.


### Start Developing to Our Voice and Messaging APIs
After you've completed your account set-up tasks, explore our inventory and order a phone number to your account. Once you have a phone number, you are ready to send your first text message or create your first phone call. For help, check out our SDK’s and Postman Collection.
