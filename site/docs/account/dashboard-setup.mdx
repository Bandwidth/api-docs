This walks through how to setup and configure your Bandwidth account through the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com) for use with our [Number Management](../../numbers), [HTTP Voice](../../voice), and [HTTP Messaging](../../messaging) APIs.

Now that we’ve covered the [hierarchical structure](structure.md) of your Bandwidth Dashboard account, let’s talk about how to complete your set-up.

Bandwidth recommends that all new users complete their account set-up using the Bandwidth Dashboard user interface to best get acquainted with our unique account structure.

After you’ve familiarized yourself with these concepts, you may want to automate your set-up and [programmatically configure](../programmatic-setup) your Sub-Accounts and Locations.

## Assumptions
- You have been contracted and given access to your Bandwidth Dashboard Account

## Steps
1. [Create a Sub-Account](#create-a-sub-account-site)
2. [Create a Location](#create-a-location-sip-peer)

## Create a Sub-Account (Site)

Once you log into the Bandwidth Dashboard, the first thing you need to do is set up your initial Sub-account.
Metaphorically speaking, if you were to look at the Account as a filing cabinet, the Sub-accounts can be best visualized as the drawers.

:::tip
Many users choose to just keep a single Sub-Account. Whereas others create two to represent Development & Production environments.
:::

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Account**, select **Sub-accounts**, and then click **Add Sub-account**.
2. Enter a name for the sub-account.
3. Enter the required information address information.
4. Click on **Create Sub-account**.

## Create a Location (SIP Peer)

A Location is where you’ll link your Application and provision other routing settings. 
When a phone number is added to a Location, it will inherit the settings and properties of that Location.

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Account**, select **Locations**, and then click **Add Location**.
2. The **Locations** tab will be selected by default. Locations can be changed for Voice and Messaging later on when required.
3. Type in a **Location Name** and optional description. You’ll order and port phone numbers to a Location. Give it a name that’s easily identifiable.
4. Select the **Sub-account** you created in the previous step.
5. If there is no default location linked to your chosen sub-account already, enable Default Location.
6. Click **Create a Location.**
