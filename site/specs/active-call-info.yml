      summary: Retrieve the risk scores for a specific phone call
      description: >-
        Retrieve fraud and spoofing risk scores for a specific phone call that
        is currently active on the Bandwidth network.


        The fraud and spoofing scores returned by this API endpoint indicate how
        likely it is that the given phone call is 

        fraudulent or that the given phone call is coming from a spoofed phone
        number.


        Currently this API endpoint only supports inbound phone calls, but it
        may support other types of calls in the future.


        **Note**: This information is generated after a call is answered and is
        cached for only 30 minutes.  If you attempt

        to query this information before the score has been generated or after
        the 30 minute cache period expires, the API

        will return an HTTP 404.
