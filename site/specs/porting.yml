    Bandwidth understands that number porting is a powerful tool that enables
    you to bring all your existing voice and text services under one umbrella.
    By porting-in your phone numbers to Bandwidth, you mitigate the disruption
    that comes from changing numbers.


    With our new Number Porting API, we are making the number porting process as
    smooth as possible! This allows you to check all existing porting orders for
    your account using available filters. For example, you can check the number
    or current status of your orders.
