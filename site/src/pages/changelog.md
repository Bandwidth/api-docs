| May 3rd, 2021 | Major overhaul to voice API spec. There are no changes to the API itself, just changes to the API spec. The API spec now uses the OpenAPI 3.0 format. Many endpoints have been renamed. Many object schemas have been renamed. Many endpoints that had missing response codes have had their missing information added. Many parameters that are optional have been marked as such. Several incorrect content-type headers have been corrected. Many strings that used to be documented as enums have been updated to be represented as strings. |
