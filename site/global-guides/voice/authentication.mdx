## Retrieving an access token

:::caution

The token should be retrieved from a server running in a secure environment and securely provided to clients. Client-side javascript does not have a mechanism for hiding these credentials so **DO NOT** place these directly in your client-side code.

Bandwidth accepts no responsibility for the loss of account credentials and any resulting network traffic, fraud, or undesired account access that results from failing to manage account access credentials in a completely secure manner.
:::


The process to retrieve an access token requires you to have your [WebRTC Credentials](./inAppGuide.mdx#generating-credentials-for-an-access-token) (ie. ClientID and ClientSecret), generated from the [Global Portal](https://login.voxbone.com/login). You will then be able to make a call to our token endpoint with these credentials.

```
### Request
In order to retrieve the token, you will use Basic Authentication `ClientID:ClientSecret`. Below is a sample request:

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://id.voxbone.com/api/v1/oauth2/token?scope=voice.webrtc \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic PEJhc2ljIEF1dGggVXNlcm5hbWU+OjxCYXNpYyBBdXRoIFBhc3N3b3JkPg==' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=client_credentials
```
Now that we've shown the request, let's break down the parts of the API call.

- **url** `https://id.voxbone.com/api/v1/oauth2/token?scope=voice.webrtc` - This is the In-App Calling AuthServers's `token_endpoint`. **IMPORTANT**: There is a query parameter of `scope`. This is used to limit the permissions in the token. When you request a token with the scope parameter that token will **ONLY** be able to access resources that require the specifiied scopes. In our example, we are limiting the token's permissions to only the WebRTC Gateway. If you do not provide a scope, then the token will be minted for **ALL** scopes that are allowed by the credentials when they were created.
- **Headers**
  - **Authorization** - This request requires authentication. You **MUST** provide your `ClientID` and `ClientSecret` in a Basic Authorization header. Basic Authentication uses a Base64 encoded string that contains the username and password.
  - **Content-Type** - For this request you **MUST** use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This will URL encode (aka percent-encode) the parameters making them into `key=value` pairs which will be separated by an ampersand `&`.
- **Body** - There is only one piece of data that must be transmitted in the form and that is the `grant_type`. Currently we only support `client_credentials` OAuth2 `grant_type`.

### Response
Am example response is:
```
{
	"access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImFsb2hvbW9yYSJ9.e30.kl3HYFQIcP4xZd78wUkdXxntxBu1d7b5ZCt99qVObC-gUZd5KSq2J7Q5rDb2LjP1_WVndcLQSqCoq3Anvp03hJWM6mamZL3dWHxjGLwkrIlzmNx9ZFGhTGIEsYLyaQqy8MonWYw2mJ4Z0APEfTVbTBHNIGrm_9GT6rIkdOwQFM-XgH1Tau4JbpFJun3n6o15WTgjzdEj9fIwd385CPwL-pAmOiozbYWUEzgqkXjSGHI11hiLDu-tv_8Ds06Cx4iCnL1F6_dFrnpD3CF0i6JJYVrvLmi6vgzoxp9YEIRBwaOZTSuYuYt03SQfbMZy8L2Z71sRKLLGt3TrxgtwyjefpQ",
	"access_token_id": "a5xA3xMKEggGwvpSLtk2lRb",
	"token_type": "Bearer",
	"expires_in": 600
}
```

Let's see what each item in the response object is meant for:
- `access_token`: This is the JSON Web Token (JWT) that will be passed in the Authorization header of the requests to the In-App Calling API. **NOTE:** The example above does not contain a valid token and cannot be used to actually authenticate.
- `access_token_id`: This will be the ID of the access token to prevent tokens from being re-used. It will be the same as the `jti` claim within the access token.
- `token_type`: This is used to identify the type of token and also the prefix to be used in the Authorization header.
- `expires_in`: This is the length of time, in seconds, before a token expires. In the example above the value is `600`. This means the token will be valid for 600 seconds (10 minutes) before it expires. You **SHOULD** use the token until 10-30 seconds before expiration, at which point you must request a new token in the same manner as described above.

### Using the Access Token

Once you have obtained the token you can perform authenticated requests to the WebRTC Gateway using the [Bandwidth WebRTC SDK](./inAppGuide.mdx#sdks).
