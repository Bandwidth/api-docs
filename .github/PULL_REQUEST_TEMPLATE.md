## For the Committer

All PRs on this repo that change any API sources of truth (markdown files, OpenAPI specs) require release notes added to the `external/markdown/release-notes.md` file. If this PR does not require release notes, you need to add the `no-release-notes` tag to this PR before opening it.

Please confirm that you have either updated `external/markdown/release-notes.md` or added the `no-release-notes` tag.
